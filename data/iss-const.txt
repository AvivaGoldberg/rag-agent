The Indian Springs School Constitution
Preamble
Under the freedom granted the faculty and students of Indian Springs School by the Board of Governors of the
Alabama Educational Foundation, the governing body of Indian Springs School, there is herewith created the official Indian
Springs School Constitution.
The purpose of the Indian Springs School Constitution and Government is to promote living and learning in accordance
with humane and democratic values and principles, thereby contributing to the intellectual, physical, emotional, spiritual, and
ethical development of all members of the Indian Springs school-community.
In establishing this Constitution, the members of the Indian Springs school-community affirm that students and teachers
do not have to accept themselves or their surroundings as they are but that it is within their power to improve both through
participation in constructive change. Such participation enhances the worth and dignity of humankind, develops responsibility,
and leads persons to the realization of latent powers.
Article I – School-Community Life
The school-community exists for the purpose of providing an environment in which each individual can develop to his
or her full stature.
I. Rights
Each individual has certain rights that are equal for each person. Individuals are guaranteed maximum freedom so long
as they do not infringe upon the rights of others or threaten the general welfare of the school-community.
This Constitution guarantees:
1. The right to freedom of religion, speech, inquiry, and criticism.
2. The right of students to select representatives in the government.
3. The right of students to run for public office.
4. The right to petition the Council or Faculty.
5. The right to assemble peacefully.
6. The right to be considered innocent until proven guilty.
II. Values and Ideals
Certain values and ideals are prized because they contribute to making the school-community a better place in which to
live and learn. Each individual is responsible for working toward the realization of these values and ideals.
In our school-community, we aspire to:
1. Show respect towards the opinions and beliefs of others.
2. Develop genuine friendships.
3. Respect the worth and dignity of the individual.
4. Widen the area of common agreement by which decisions are made and actions taken.
5. Develop personal integrity and moral courage.
6. Help individuals to develop their talents and skills.
7. Stimulate individuals to give direct, unselfish service to the school-community.
8. Reflect disapproval of behavior wherein one individual does or says things harmful to another or to the good name of
the school.
9. Prohibit any organized group that divides or tends to divide the school-community.
We encourage individuals to:
1. Accept their political responsibilities.
2. Keep informed about school-community jobs because the general welfare requires it.
3. Voice opinions and demands directly to the proper officials.
4. Use democratic methods to achieve group agreement.
5. Consider the common good before group or personal liberties.
6. Live in accordance with agreed-upon standards.
7. Evaluate the school-community continuously in an effort to improve it.
Article II – Structure of the Government
The divisions of government are:
1. The Director of Indian Springs School, who is appointed by the Board of Governors.
2. The Administration.
3. The Faculty.
4. The Student Government:
a. Town Meeting: a legislative body comprised of all students that, second to the Administration and Faculty, is the
authority of government at Indian Springs.
b. Council: an executive body comprised of the Mayor, the Commissions, and the Class Representatives. c.
Judiciary: a judicial body comprised of students who hear and rule on infractions of policies, rules, and standards.
Article III – Town Meeting
The heart of the Government at Indian Springs School is the Town Meeting. Town Meeting is open to all citizens and
has three main functions:
1. The Town Meeting serves as the legislative branch of Government and is the final authority on all issues in which the
Faculty is neutral. While the Town Meeting is open to all citizens, only students are allowed to vote. Three-quarters
of the student body constitutes a quorum. Decisions will be made by at least a two-thirds majority vote. The
presiding officer will determine whether the voting will be secret or public.
2. The Town Meeting serves as an open forum in which students can freely voice their concerns and opinions about
pressing issues in an effort to improve the overall quality of life in the school-community.
3. The Town Meeting is a means of communication among all citizens of the school-community. Because a democracy
cannot survive unless its citizens remain consistently informed, weekly meetings are encouraged; however, the
frequency of meetings is determined by need.
Town Meetings are called either by the Mayor with the consent of the Faculty or by the Faculty. Students have the right to
request to have a Town Meeting either through the Council, Faculty, or Director. The Mayor has the right to call a
students-only Town Meeting.
The presiding officer of the Town Meeting is the Mayor. In the absence of the Mayor, the Council will designate a presiding
officer. However, if the Town Meeting is called by the Faculty, the Director or someone designated by the Faculty may take
charge of the meeting.
Article IV – The Council
The Council is a body of students elected entirely by the students for the purpose of providing leadership in the
community. The most important responsibility of the Council is to assess the quality of school-community life and improve it
on as many levels as possible.
I. The offices of the Council are:
1. The Mayor, whose duty is to provide leadership for the Council and the community as a whole in building a greater
understanding of the aims and purposes of the community and to bring about the realization of these aims and
purposes through the various Council offices. The Mayor is responsible for seeing that each Council office fulfills
its respective duties and platforms and for coordinating the work of the Council.
2. Commission of Citizenship, whose duties are concerned with the continuing evaluation of the quality of citizenship as
exhibited on a day-to-day basis, in and out of the classroom, and in the larger community beyond the boundaries
of Indian Springs School. Specific examples can include, but are not limited to, organizing Development Day,
promoting service opportunities, and overseeing student clubs.
3. Commission of Education, whose duties are concerned with the continuing evaluation and improvement of teaching
and learning and of the conditions that influence the academic experience. Specific examples can include, but are
not limited to, managing the Writing Center, creating a student tutor system, and participating in Academics
Committee meetings.
4. Commission of Protection, whose duties are concerned with the enforcement of the standards of the school-community
and the promotion of environmental protection. Specific examples can include, but are not limited to, reporting
attendance at mandatory meetings and issuing Records for unexcused absences at such meetings, organizing and
carrying out campus recycling, and discouraging littering, and managing matters surrounding the American flag(s)
flown on campus. Members of the commission are, in a special sense, guardians of the rights, values, principles, and
ideals set out in this Constitution. The preferred method of enforcement of such standards is persuasion. However,
where persuasion does not prove successful, the commission may take more stringent measures.
5. Commission of Recreation, whose duties are concerned with the continuing evaluation and improvement of wholesome
recreational activities in the school-community. Specific examples can include, but are not limited to, organizing
school dances, planning Winter Formal, and leading activities that promote school spirit.
6. Commission of Services, whose duties are concerned with the continuing evaluation and improvement of the range of
needed services in the school-community. The most evident example of this duty is the operation of the student
store.
7. Commission of Boarding, whose duties are concerned with the continuing evaluation and improvement of dormitory
life, which involves the facilitation and execution of dormitory administration such as maintenance and rule
enforcement. The Commission is to be elected from and by the boarding student community as outlined in Article VII.
8. Deputies, who are students installed by a specific Commission to aid in the execution of its duties and to expand
community participation in Government. Each Commission may have up to three Deputies, with the exception of
Commissioners of Boarding, who may have up to two deputies in each dormitory. No one in any of the Council
offices may become a Deputy, and Deputies may serve only one Commission. Deputies are nominated by the
Commission and must be approved individually by the Council. The Commission or the Council may remove a Deputy
at any time; when a Commission leaves office, the Deputies of that Commission also leave their posts. Deputies do
not have a vote in the Council but are strongly encouraged to attend Council meetings.
9. Class Representatives, whose duties are concerned with the continuing evaluation of opinions and desires of their
respective classes. Class Representatives are responsible for organizing and voicing class concerns to the Council
and for taking attendance for their respective grades at mandatory meetings. Each class will elect one or two
representatives from its own class and for its own class.
10. The Council Secretary, whose duties are concerned with the documentation and communication of recent plans,
updates, and discussions mentioned during Student Government and Town Meetings and contributing to task
management within the Council. Specific examples can include, but are not limited to, taking notes during Council
meetings, taking notes during Town Meetings, and assisting the Mayor in certain projects. These notes must be
reviewed and approved by the Council before their release. The Council Secretary does not have a vote in the
Council. The Council Secretary is nominated by the Mayor and must be approved individually by the Council through a
⅔majority vote.
II. Additional responsibilities of the Council:
1. Each office of the Council must prepare a written platform, a program of action to be implemented during the specified
term of office. This platform should present the goals and methodology for the office.
2. The Council should hold regular meetings to discuss and evaluate ongoing programs. The meetings are compulsory for
all members unless a viable excuse is given. Embracing the principles of democracy, all members of the school
community are encouraged to attend Council meetings.
3. The Council must, at times, make decisions on items such as those called for in this Constitution. In order to make
these decisions, the Council must vote. Three-quarters of the Council constitutes a quorum, and decisions will be
made by a two-thirds majority vote.
4. The Council must administer elections at the end of each semester, as outlined in Article VII.
5. The Mayor has final responsibility for the effectiveness of the Council, and the Director of Indian Springs School has
final responsibility for the effectiveness of the Faculty Liaisons, which are mentor Faculty members assigned to
each Commission and Class. It is the duty of the Mayor and Director to see that the Commissions and Liaisons
develop a unified program in order to improve specific aspects of the school-community from the vantage point of
a comprehensive view of school-community problems.
Article V – The Judiciary
The Indian Springs School Judiciary is a panel elected entirely by the students for the purpose of hearing and ruling on
infractions of policies, rules, and standards within the school-community. The Judiciary is composed of eleven students and
one Faculty Liaison. The eleven-member panel must be composed of one 8th (for the second semester only), one 9th, one
10th, one 11th, and one 12th grader as well as two boarding students, elected by popular vote by the entire student body.
Once these stipulations have been met, the remaining spots will be filled by those receiving the highest number of votes. Any
student who wishes to run for the Judiciary is both welcome and encouraged to do so. The Faculty has no input regarding
who is allowed to run.
I. Offices of Judiciary
There are two offices of Judiciary: the Head of Judiciary and the Student Recorder. Both positions are elected at the first
Judiciary meeting following general elections by a combined panel of incoming and outgoing members of the Judiciary. Voting
is anonymous, and offices are decided by majority vote.
1. The Head of Judiciary is the leader of the panel and serves as a guide and moderator during discussions rather than a
member advocating their own opinions. The Head of Judiciary has no vote during regular meetings except in the case of a tie,
where they serve as a tiebreaker. In order to run for Head of Judiciary, a student must have previously served at least one
term on the panel, if there is such a person. The Head of Judiciary is responsible for organizing meeting times, bringing a
copy of the Read ‘n’ Heed, Records, and precedents to every meeting, taking attendance at meetings, and notifying the
accused of the accused offense as well as the date, time, and location of the hearing. After each hearing, it is the Head’s
responsibility to provide the Dean of Student Life with a report of all cases, rulings, and work hours or other punishments
given.
2. The Student Recorder keeps an accurate record of the decisions made by the Judiciary and serves as the
Impeachment Recorder during the impeachment of a Council member as outlined in Article VIII. In the event of the Head of
Judiciary receiving a Record, the Student Recorder assumes the role of Head of Judiciary for that case.
II. The Faculty Liaison
The Faculty Liaison to the Judiciary is the Faculty’s representation on the panel. They serve only as a guide; students
maintain the primary responsibility and control of the Judiciary. The Faculty Liaison may voice an opinion, act as a clarifier
and interpreter of the rules, and assist in interrogating the accused. They may not vote during regular meetings or during
the election of offices. The Faculty Liaison is responsible for creating a written memo of all proceedings of the Judiciary to
distribute to the Director, the Dean of Academics, the Dean of Student Life, and the Dean of Residential Life. The Faculty
Liaison is expected to abide by all policies, rules, and procedures of the Judiciary.
III. The Dean of Student Life
The Dean of Student Life is not a member of the Judiciary and is not present during meetings; they serve as an outside
assistant in executing the administrative duties of the Judiciary. After each meeting, an outline of all decisions, including a
breakdown of the work hours and/or other punishments and their corresponding offenses, is given to the Dean of Student
Life by the Head of Judiciary. The Dean of Student Life is responsible for notifying each student and their Faculty Advisor of
the work hour assignment and/or other punishment given by the Judiciary. It is the Dean of Student Life’s responsibility to
keep track of work hours performed and time frames for other punishments for each student. When a Faculty member
submits a record, they are to be informed of the case’s outcome by the Dean of Student Life.
IV. Judiciary Procedure
Persuasion is the primary means of enforcement of the rules in the school-community. However, acknowledging that a
warning may not alter behavior in all situations, a Record may be issued after persuasion has been attempted. Any member of
the community may write a Record to report a rule infraction. Records are submitted to the Head of Judiciary through email.
In the Record, the accuser should provide a detailed written explanation of the situation along with any other relevant
information. If there is not enough information from the accuser to prove guilt, the accused should be deemed innocent. Prior
to the
hearing, the Head of Judiciary may ask the accuser if there is more information associated with the record. The responsibility
for providing details falls on the accuser in order for the Judiciary to remain the jury rather than the prosecutor. The accuser
may choose to remain anonymous during the proceedings of the hearing. The accuser should provide all relevant information
in the original record, but may request to attend the hearing if he or she would like to provide additional information. When a
Record is submitted, the Head will alert the Judiciary, the accused, and the accuser (when necessary) of the date, time, and
location of the hearing. Meetings should be called as regularly as possible. Six members of the Judiciary other than the Head
must be present to constitute a quorum.
The accused must appear before the Judiciary on the specified day. If the accused does not do so and does not provide a
viable excuse, they will automatically be given a set punishment. On the day of the hearing, the Head will read the Record
aloud and explain the case to the Judiciary. The Judiciary will then summon and question the accused concerning all aspects
of the case and any connected incidents. Upon completion, the accused will leave the room. Only the eleven members of the
Judiciary and the Faculty Liaison are allowed to be present during deliberation. The panel must first determine if the accused is
innocent or guilty. The accused is considered innocent until proven guilty. If the accused is deemed guilty, the precedent
system—a written record of past rule infractions and their correlating punishments—will be used as a guide during the
deliberation of punishment. However, due to the uniqueness of each case, the precedent system should not necessarily be
followed. Finally, the Judiciary will set a punishment by majority vote. If at any point during the process the Judiciary
determines it has inadequate information, the panel reserves the right to postpone a case until more information has been
gathered from relevant parties. The accused may also be summoned for additional questioning for clarification.
On the following school day, the accused must report to the Dean of Student Life to receive their punishment. If work
hours were assigned, the accused must then contact the appropriate adult to establish a schedule for the completion of the
work hours. If the work hours are not completed within the set time period, the accused will be charged with “work hour
delinquency,” and the uncompleted number of hours shall be doubled automatically. If the accused vehemently maintains their
innocence yet is given work hours, they have the right to formally submit an appeal by email to the Judiciary. After the Dean
of Student Life and the Director are notified of the petition, the Judiciary will hold another hearing to reexamine evidence and
question relevant parties.
Strict confidentiality must be maintained throughout the entire Judiciary process.
V. Judiciary Rules
1. All Judiciary members and the Faculty Liaison must act with seriousness of purpose, maintain respectful conduct, and
lead by example. This is of the utmost importance to the effectiveness of the Judiciary, which must maintain the
respect of the community to function properly.
2. All Judiciary members have equal say and power regardless of age or experience.
3. Those hearing the case and receiving summary memos must maintain the confidentiality of all proceedings and
outcomes. There will be no discussion of the decision-making process in front of the accused. Only the accused has
the right to discuss the Judiciary’s decision; it is that person’s decision alone to discuss their case.
4. If a Judiciary member is responsible for issuing a record, that member will not vote on that case or be present for its
deliberation.
5. If a Judiciary member receives a Record, that member may not be present during the deliberation of the case.
6. Personal bias of any kind against anyone may not affect the vote or discussion of a case. If a panel member feels
unable to ignore a bias, they should recuse themselves from the case.
7. If the accused is found guilty of breaking a rule, even if members of the Judiciary disagree with the rule, the Judiciary
must punish it accordingly.
8. The Judiciary is responsible for punishing any rule infractions that are uncovered during a hearing.
9. The Judiciary must meet at least once per term for a self-evaluation and discussion of any necessary changes to these
rules and the procedures herein.
10. The Judiciary may not assign cruel or unusual punishments.
11. Judiciary members are expected to attend every meeting. A member is allowed one unexcused absence before
being removed from the panel. A member is allowed four excused absences. At the fourth absence, if the absences
are deemed disruptive to the panel’s functioning, the Head of Judiciary will conduct a vote regarding the removal of
the member. In the case of any vacancy, a special election must be held as outlined in Article VII.
12. All Judiciary members must abide by these rules and procedures or be removed from the Judiciary.
Article VI – Measures Governing Behavior
The price of freedom is responsibility embodied by self-restraint and obligation. Regulations are put forth by the
Administration, the Faculty, and the Students to maintain the community’s values and the balance of freedom and
responsibility. The specific regulations can be found in the Reed-N-Heed.
I. Administrative Policies
Administrative policies are limited to issues deemed particularly significant by the Director. They are related to the
advancement of the school’s mission and the protection of the school’s good name. The development of these policies is
the responsibility of the Director alone.
II. Faculty Policies
Faculty policies are the rules and policies deemed to be significant by the Faculty. In general, they are concerned with
the school’s operation and the safety and well being of the student body. While the Faculty has the final say in the
development of Faculty Policy, students have the right to propose any revisions they see fit. Any Faculty member may
propose an amendment to the Faculty Policy. The proposed alteration is taken to the Faculty to be voted on. The
Administration may veto a proposed policy.
Note to Sections I and II:
The Administration and Faculty pledge to hear student opinion relating to the formulation of policies
that concern students, but they reserve the right to make decisions independent of the majority
opinion of students. While the Administration and Faculty are obligated to explain to the students the
reasoning behind actions taken, students’ opinions do not affect a policy’s introduction into the
Read-N-Heed.
III. Student Standards
In keeping with a commitment to the widest possible student participation in government, the Faculty shall designate
realms of the school-community in which students shall be free to govern as described in the Read-N-Heed. Such areas are
intended to develop in students a sense of duty in the exercise of freedom. The designation of Student Standards assumes
close cooperation between Faculty and Students. Students should only petition the Faculty for such designation after sufficient
prior cooperative thinking and planning by representatives of the Faculty and Council. Both Faculty and Students are
responsible for creating a favorable and supportive atmosphere when Students petition to claim a standard. The Faculty shall
refrain from transferring a Faculty Policy to Students unless there is evidence of widespread desire on the part of Students to
undertake responsible management of that area. There should be ongoing discussion between Faculty and Students regarding
the management of an assumed Standard. Faculty may not mandate changes in Standards or in Student enforcement
procedures of the Standards. It is the Faculty’s duty to re-assume control of a Student Standard if students fail to show
responsibility in their governance of that area. In withdrawing a designation of a Student Standard, the Faculty will give its
reasons first to the Council, and then to the Town Meeting, but there is no implication of a right to veto by either group.
The preferred means of enforcement of all Student Standards is persuasion, which if ineffective, may be followed by
a Record as outlined in Article V.
Student Standards are formulated by the following procedure:
Students should initiate an inquiry into the possibility of assuming responsibility for an area, or Faculty may encourage
students to assume responsibility for an area. Any student, in consultation with any member of the school-community they
choose, writes a proposal for standards or revisions to be implemented in the area in question. Faculty may also propose
changes to existing standards. There will be small group discussions of the proposed standards and means of enforcement.
The final proposal is then submitted to and reviewed by the Council. The Council will then hold a vote. If the proposed
revision passes the Council, the revisions will then be voted on in a Faculty meeting. Representatives from the Council should
attend the Faculty meeting in order to maintain thorough communication. If it passes the Faculty, the proposed Standards
must be presented in a Town Meeting and voted on for final approval. For the amendment to pass the Council, Faculty, and
Town Meeting, the revisions must have a two-thirds majority support of each. If the consultation procedure does not produce
widespread commitment to the proposal on the part of students, the Mayor will remand the matter to the originating group for
further consideration.
At the beginning of the school year, the Council should review existing standards and present them to the Town
Meeting (or to small groups) for consideration and possible revision. Standards of the preceding year are in effect until this
is done.
Article VII – Elections
In order for a democracy to survive, it must be self-perpetuating through the orderly and fair transition of power by
means of open elections.
1. Elections for the Council and the Judiciary will be held biannually near the end of each semester.
2. Only students are allowed to vote in elections. Every student, regardless of circumstance, is allowed and encouraged
to vote.
3. The Faculty has no input in who is allowed to run. Any student may run for a position regardless of circumstance.
4. In order to run for a public office, students must petition. The Council will specify and publicize the nature of the
petition for each office. Petitions for Mayor and Commissions must include platforms and signatures as defined
in Article IV and the Council is responsible for making all platforms public.
5. While students may run for only one office in the Council, they are permitted to run for the Judiciary in addition to an
office in the Council.
6. Each candidate is entrusted with using their best judgment in carrying out a campaign, should they choose to have
one. All campaign material must be appropriate and aimed at positively portraying a candidate rather than negatively
portraying a competitor. The Council may vote to disqualify a candidate who has deviated from these requirements.
7. A special Town Meeting will be held prior to each election day in which candidates may make speeches presenting their
platforms. The Council will administer this Town Meeting and make public the agenda thereof before the meeting.
8. Voting will be by secret ballot after the special Town Meeting. The Council must determine the optimal method to
conduct a fair and impartial voting process, which should be made public before voting commences. The Council
may appoint other students and Faculty members to assist them.
9. The Council will tally the votes and may appoint other students and Faculty members to assist them. The numerical
statistics are to be kept completely confidential, with only the results of the election posted and not the number of
votes each candidate received.
10. Election is by an Alternative Vote. Voters will be given the option to rank the candidates in order of First Choice,
Second Choice, etc. If the candidate with the highest number of First Choice votes obtains a majority, they win the
election. If said candidate does not receive a majority of all votes cast, the candidate with the lowest number of
First Option votes will drop out and their votes will transfer to each respective voter’s Second Choice. This process
will repeat automatically until there is a clear majority winner.
11. If less than three-quarters of the student body participates in the election, there will be a re-election. Elections for
the Commission of Boarding will require three-quarters participation from the boarding student community.
12. No candidate for an election may assist in the election process. Therefore, Council members who plan to run in the
election may neither participate in decisions that the Council makes concerning the election nor assist in
administering the voting or counting.
13. The Council must choose the members who are primarily responsible for conducting the election process. Usually,
this duty is allotted to either the Commission of Citizenship or the Commission of Protection. However, if students
holding both Commissions plan to run for office, the Council must elect two impartial council members to run the
election.
14. In the case of a vacancy in the offices of the Mayor or the Commissions, the Town Meeting must decide by a two
thirds majority vote whether or not the vacancy should be filled. In the case of a vacancy in the offices of the
Class Representatives, the relevant Class Meeting will decide by a two-thirds majority vote whether or not the
vacancy should be filled. If it is decided that a vacancy should be filled, the normal election procedure will take
place. If a vacancy should arise in the Judiciary, the vacancy must be filled by a special election.
Article VIII – Impeachment of Elected Officials
Any member of the Indian Springs school-community can suggest the impeachment of an elected student official.
There are separate processes for the impeachment and removal of students from various offices.
I. Students holding the offices of the Council may be accused and impeached by the following process:
1. The accuser must present the proposal of impeachment to the Judiciary, either in person or in writing, giving specific
reasons for impeachment. The accuser has the option to remain anonymous.
2. The Judiciary will install the Student Recorder as the Impeachment Recorder to record the arguments and proceedings
of the impeachment trial. If the Student Recorder is unable to be impartial, another member of the Judiciary may be
elected by majority vote to be the Impeachment Recorder.
3. The Judiciary can decide on the manner in which to conduct the trial but must hear both the accuser’s and the
accused’s arguments. Based on the trial, the Judiciary will decide by majority vote whether or not the
proposed impeachment should continue to the Town Meeting or the Class Meeting.
4. If the Judiciary decides to advance the impeachment case of a Class Representative, then the case will go to the
respective Class Meeting. Cases for all other Council offices will advance to the Town Meeting. The proceedings in
the preliminary stages (outlined in a, b, and c) are to remain completely confidential even after the Town Meeting
or the Class Meeting, if one is held. Only the information and arguments that the Judiciary deems important
enough for the Impeachment Recorder to present in public meetings may be disclosed, in the case of a Town
Meeting or Class Meeting. Only the Impeachment Recorder may present such information.
5. The Impeachment Recorder must make a presentation to the Town Meeting if the accused is a Mayor or
Commissioner, or to the Class Meeting if the accused is a Class Representative. This presentation should include the
accusations against the official and the accused official’s defense in an equal and unbiased manner. Students in the
Town Meeting or Class Meeting will then vote by secret ballot on whether or not to remove the impeached official
from office. If the impeachment passes the Town Meeting or Class Meeting by a two-thirds majority, the official will
be removed from office immediately.
6. The vacancy procedure outlined in Article VII will determine whether or not a special election will be held.
II. Students holding chairs on the Judiciary may be accused and impeached by the following process:
1. The accuser must present the proposal of impeachment to the Council, either in person or in writing, giving specific
reasons for impeachment. The accuser has the option to remain anonymous.
2. The Council must elect by majority vote an impartial member of the Council to be the Impeachment Recorder to record
the arguments and proceedings of the impeachment trial.
3. The Council can decide on the manner in which to conduct the trial but must hear both the accuser’s and the accused’s
arguments. Based on the trial, the Council will decide by a two-thirds majority vote whether or not the proposed
impeachment should continue to the Town Meeting.
4. The proceedings in the preliminary stages (outlined in a, b, and c) are to remain completely confidential even after the
Town Meeting, if one is held. Only the information and arguments that the Council deems important enough for the
Impeachment Recorder to present in a public meeting may be disclosed, in the case of a Town Meeting. Only the
Impeachment Recorder may present such information.
5. The Impeachment Recorder must present the accusations against the official and the defenses of the accused to the
Town Meeting in an equal and unbiased manner. Students will then vote by secret ballot on whether or not to
remove the impeached official from office. If the impeachment passes the Town Meeting by a two-thirds majority,
the official will be removed from office immediately.
6. In the case that a Judiciary member is impeached, there must be a special election to fill the vacancy.
Article IX – Amendments
Provided that every member of the school-community has the power and obligation to improve it through constructive
change, any person may submit a proposal to amend the Constitution at any time during the academic year. The proposed
amendment must first be submitted to and reviewed by the Council. The Council will hold a vote. If the proposed
amendment passes the Council, the revisions will then go to a Faculty meeting to be voted on. Representatives from the
Council should attend the Faculty meeting in order to maintain thorough communication. If it passes the Faculty, the
revisions must be presented in a Town Meeting and voted on for final approval. For the amendment to pass the Council,
Faculty, and Town
Meeting, the revisions must have two-thirds majority support of each. If at any point significant revisions are made to
an amendment, the process will begin again with the Council’s review.

7. Evaluate the school-community continuously in an effort to improve it.
Article II – Structure of the Government
The divisions of government are:
1. The Director of Indian Springs School, who is appointed by the Board of Governors.
2. The Administration.
3. The Faculty.
4. The Student Government:
a. Town Meeting: a legislative body comprised of all students that, second to the Administration and Faculty, is the
authority of government at Indian Springs.
b. Council: an executive body comprised of the Mayor, the Commissions, and the Class Representatives. c.
Judiciary: a judicial body comprised of students who hear and rule on infractions of policies, rules, and standards.
Article III – Town Meeting
The heart of the Government at Indian Springs School is the Town Meeting. Town Meeting is open to all citizens and
has three main functions:
1. The Town Meeting serves as the legislative branch of Government and is the final authority on all issues in which the
Faculty is neutral. While the Town Meeting is open to all citizens, only students are allowed to vote. Three-quarters
of the student body constitutes a quorum. Decisions will be made by at least a two-thirds majority vote. The
presiding officer will determine whether the voting will be secret or public.
2. The Town Meeting serves as an open forum in which students can freely voice their concerns and opinions about
pressing issues in an effort to improve the overall quality of life in the school-community.
3. The Town Meeting is a means of communication among all citizens of the school-community. Because a democracy
cannot survive unless its citizens remain consistently informed, weekly meetings are encouraged; however, the
frequency of meetings is determined by need.
Town Meetings are called either by the Mayor with the consent of the Faculty or by the Faculty. Students have the right to
request to have a Town Meeting either through the Council, Faculty, or Director. The Mayor has the right to call a
students-only Town Meeting.
The presiding officer of the Town Meeting is the Mayor. In the absence of the Mayor, the Council will designate a presiding
officer. However, if the Town Meeting is called by the Faculty, the Director or someone designated by the Faculty may take
charge of the meeting.
Article IV – The Council
The Council is a body of students elected entirely by the students for the purpose of providing leadership in the
community. The most important responsibility of the Council is to assess the quality of school-community life and improve it
on as many levels as possible.
I. The offices of the Council are:
1. The Mayor, whose duty is to provide leadership for the Council and the community as a whole in building a greater
understanding of the aims and purposes of the community and to bring about the realization of these aims and
purposes through the various Council offices. The Mayor is responsible for seeing that each Council office fulfills
its respective duties and platforms and for coordinating the work of the Council.
2. Commission of Citizenship, whose duties are concerned with the continuing evaluation of the quality of citizenship as
exhibited on a day-to-day basis, in and out of the classroom, and in the larger community beyond the boundaries
of Indian Springs School. Specific examples can include, but are not limited to, organizing Development Day,
promoting service opportunities, and overseeing student clubs.
3. Commission of Education, whose duties are concerned with the continuing evaluation and improvement of teaching
and learning and of the conditions that influence the academic experience. Specific examples can include, but are
not limited to, managing the Writing Center, creating a student tutor system, and participating in Academics
Committee meetings.
4. Commission of Protection, whose duties are concerned with the enforcement of the standards of the school-community
and the promotion of environmental protection. Specific examples can include, but are not limited to, reporting
attendance at mandatory meetings and issuing Records for unexcused absences at such meetings, organizing and
carrying out campus recycling, and discouraging littering, and managing matters surrounding the American flag(s)
flown on campus. Members of the commission are, in a special sense, guardians of the rights, values, principles, and
ideals set out in this Constitution. The preferred method of enforcement of such standards is persuasion. However,
where persuasion does not prove successful, the commission may take more stringent measures.
5. Commission of Recreation, whose duties are concerned with the continuing evaluation and improvement of wholesome
recreational activities in the school-community. Specific examples can include, but are not limited to, organizing
school dances, planning Winter Formal, and leading activities that promote school spirit.
6. Commission of Services, whose duties are concerned with the continuing evaluation and improvement of the range of
needed services in the school-community. The most evident example of this duty is the operation of the student
store.
7. Commission of Boarding, whose duties are concerned with the continuing evaluation and improvement of dormitory
life, which involves the facilitation and execution of dormitory administration such as maintenance and rule
enforcement. The Commission is to be elected from and by the boarding student community as outlined in Article VII.
8. Deputies, who are students installed by a specific Commission to aid in the execution of its duties and to expand
community participation in Government. Each Commission may have up to three Deputies, with the exception of
Commissioners of Boarding, who may have up to two deputies in each dormitory. No one in any of the Council
offices may become a Deputy, and Deputies may serve only one Commission. Deputies are nominated by the
Commission and must be approved individually by the Council. The Commission or the Council may remove a Deputy
at any time; when a Commission leaves office, the Deputies of that Commission also leave their posts. Deputies do
not have a vote in the Council but are strongly encouraged to attend Council meetings.
9. Class Representatives, whose duties are concerned with the continuing evaluation of opinions and desires of their
respective classes. Class Representatives are responsible for organizing and voicing class concerns to the Council
and for taking attendance for their respective grades at mandatory meetings. Each class will elect one or two
representatives from its own class and for its own class.
10. The Council Secretary, whose duties are concerned with the documentation and communication of recent plans,
updates, and discussions mentioned during Student Government and Town Meetings and contributing to task
management within the Council. Specific examples can include, but are not limited to, taking notes during Council
meetings, taking notes during Town Meetings, and assisting the Mayor in certain projects. These notes must be
reviewed and approved by the Council before their release. The Council Secretary does not have a vote in the
Council. The Council Secretary is nominated by the Mayor and must be approved individually by the Council through a
⅔majority vote.
II. Additional responsibilities of the Council:
1. Each office of the Council must prepare a written platform, a program of action to be implemented during the specified
term of office. This platform should present the goals and methodology for the office.
2. The Council should hold regular meetings to discuss and evaluate ongoing programs. The meetings are compulsory for
all members unless a viable excuse is given. Embracing the principles of democracy, all members of the school
community are encouraged to attend Council meetings.
3. The Council must, at times, make decisions on items such as those called for in this Constitution. In order to make
these decisions, the Council must vote. Three-quarters of the Council constitutes a quorum, and decisions will be
made by a two-thirds majority vote.
4. The Council must administer elections at the end of each semester, as outlined in Article VII.
5. The Mayor has final responsibility for the effectiveness of the Council, and the Director of Indian Springs School has
final responsibility for the effectiveness of the Faculty Liaisons, which are mentor Faculty members assigned to
each Commission and Class. It is the duty of the Mayor and Director to see that the Commissions and Liaisons
develop a unified program in order to improve specific aspects of the school-community from the vantage point of
a comprehensive view of school-community problems.
Article V – The Judiciary
The Indian Springs School Judiciary is a panel elected entirely by the students for the purpose of hearing and ruling on
infractions of policies, rules, and standards within the school-community. The Judiciary is composed of eleven students and
one Faculty Liaison. The eleven-member panel must be composed of one 8th (for the second semester only), one 9th, one
10th, one 11th, and one 12th grader as well as two boarding students, elected by popular vote by the entire student body.
Once these stipulations have been met, the remaining spots will be filled by those receiving the highest number of votes. Any
student who wishes to run for the Judiciary is both welcome and encouraged to do so. The Faculty has no input regarding
who is allowed to run.
I. Offices of Judiciary
There are two offices of Judiciary: the Head of Judiciary and the Student Recorder. Both positions are elected at the first
Judiciary meeting following general elections by a combined panel of incoming and outgoing members of the Judiciary. Voting
is anonymous, and offices are decided by majority vote.
1. The Head of Judiciary is the leader of the panel and serves as a guide and moderator during discussions rather than a
member advocating their own opinions. The Head of Judiciary has no vote during regular meetings except in the case of a tie,
where they serve as a tiebreaker. In order to run for Head of Judiciary, a student must have previously served at least one
term on the panel, if there is such a person. The Head of Judiciary is responsible for organizing meeting times, bringing a
copy of the Read ‘n’ Heed, Records, and precedents to every meeting, taking attendance at meetings, and notifying the
accused of the accused offense as well as the date, time, and location of the hearing. After each hearing, it is the Head’s
responsibility to provide the Dean of Student Life with a report of all cases, rulings, and work hours or other punishments
given.
2. The Student Recorder keeps an accurate record of the decisions made by the Judiciary and serves as the
Impeachment Recorder during the impeachment of a Council member as outlined in Article VIII. In the event of the Head of
Judiciary receiving a Record, the Student Recorder assumes the role of Head of Judiciary for that case.
II. The Faculty Liaison
The Faculty Liaison to the Judiciary is the Faculty’s representation on the panel. They serve only as a guide; students
maintain the primary responsibility and control of the Judiciary. The Faculty Liaison may voice an opinion, act as a clarifier
and interpreter of the rules, and assist in interrogating the accused. They may not vote during regular meetings or during
the election of offices. The Faculty Liaison is responsible for creating a written memo of all proceedings of the Judiciary to
distribute to the Director, the Dean of Academics, the Dean of Student Life, and the Dean of Residential Life. The Faculty
Liaison is expected to abide by all policies, rules, and procedures of the Judiciary.
III. The Dean of Student Life
The Dean of Student Life is not a member of the Judiciary and is not present during meetings; they serve as an outside
assistant in executing the administrative duties of the Judiciary. After each meeting, an outline of all decisions, including a
breakdown of the work hours and/or other punishments and their corresponding offenses, is given to the Dean of Student
Life by the Head of Judiciary. The Dean of Student Life is responsible for notifying each student and their Faculty Advisor of
the work hour assignment and/or other punishment given by the Judiciary. It is the Dean of Student Life’s responsibility to
keep track of work hours performed and time frames for other punishments for each student. When a Faculty member
submits a record, they are to be informed of the case’s outcome by the Dean of Student Life.
IV. Judiciary Procedure
Persuasion is the primary means of enforcement of the rules in the school-community. However, acknowledging that a
warning may not alter behavior in all situations, a Record may be issued after persuasion has been attempted. Any member of
the community may write a Record to report a rule infraction. Records are submitted to the Head of Judiciary through email.
In the Record, the accuser should provide a detailed written explanation of the situation along with any other relevant
information. If there is not enough information from the accuser to prove guilt, the accused should be deemed innocent. Prior
to the
hearing, the Head of Judiciary may ask the accuser if there is more information associated with the record. The responsibility
for providing details falls on the accuser in order for the Judiciary to remain the jury rather than the prosecutor. The accuser
may choose to remain anonymous during the proceedings of the hearing. The accuser should provide all relevant information
in the original record, but may request to attend the hearing if he or she would like to provide additional information. When a
Record is submitted, the Head will alert the Judiciary, the accused, and the accuser (when necessary) of the date, time, and
location of the hearing. Meetings should be called as regularly as possible. Six members of the Judiciary other than the Head
must be present to constitute a quorum.
The accused must appear before the Judiciary on the specified day. If the accused does not do so and does not provide a
viable excuse, they will automatically be given a set punishment. On the day of the hearing, the Head will read the Record
aloud and explain the case to the Judiciary. The Judiciary will then summon and question the accused concerning all aspects
of the case and any connected incidents. Upon completion, the accused will leave the room. Only the eleven members of the
Judiciary and the Faculty Liaison are allowed to be present during deliberation. The panel must first determine if the accused is
innocent or guilty. The accused is considered innocent until proven guilty. If the accused is deemed guilty, the precedent
system—a written record of past rule infractions and their correlating punishments—will be used as a guide during the
deliberation of punishment. However, due to the uniqueness of each case, the precedent system should not necessarily be
followed. Finally, the Judiciary will set a punishment by majority vote. If at any point during the process the Judiciary
determines it has inadequate information, the panel reserves the right to postpone a case until more information has been
gathered from relevant parties. The accused may also be summoned for additional questioning for clarification.
On the following school day, the accused must report to the Dean of Student Life to receive their punishment. If work
hours were assigned, the accused must then contact the appropriate adult to establish a schedule for the completion of the
work hours. If the work hours are not completed within the set time period, the accused will be charged with “work hour
delinquency,” and the uncompleted number of hours shall be doubled automatically. If the accused vehemently maintains their
innocence yet is given work hours, they have the right to formally submit an appeal by email to the Judiciary. After the Dean
of Student Life and the Director are notified of the petition, the Judiciary will hold another hearing to reexamine evidence and
question relevant parties.
Strict confidentiality must be maintained throughout the entire Judiciary process.
V. Judiciary Rules
1. All Judiciary members and the Faculty Liaison must act with seriousness of purpose, maintain respectful conduct, and
lead by example. This is of the utmost importance to the effectiveness of the Judiciary, which must maintain the
respect of the community to function properly.
2. All Judiciary members have equal say and power regardless of age or experience.
3. Those hearing the case and receiving summary memos must maintain the confidentiality of all proceedings and
outcomes. There will be no discussion of the decision-making process in front of the accused. Only the accused has
the right to discuss the Judiciary’s decision; it is that person’s decision alone to discuss their case.
4. If a Judiciary member is responsible for issuing a record, that member will not vote on that case or be present for its
deliberation.
5. If a Judiciary member receives a Record, that member may not be present during the deliberation of the case.
6. Personal bias of any kind against anyone may not affect the vote or discussion of a case. If a panel member feels
unable to ignore a bias, they should recuse themselves from the case.
7. If the accused is found guilty of breaking a rule, even if members of the Judiciary disagree with the rule, the Judiciary
must punish it accordingly.
8. The Judiciary is responsible for punishing any rule infractions that are uncovered during a hearing.
9. The Judiciary must meet at least once per term for a self-evaluation and discussion of any necessary changes to these
rules and the procedures herein.
10. The Judiciary may not assign cruel or unusual punishments.
11. Judiciary members are expected to attend every meeting. A member is allowed one unexcused absence before
being removed from the panel. A member is allowed four excused absences. At the fourth absence, if the absences
are deemed disruptive to the panel’s functioning, the Head of Judiciary will conduct a vote regarding the removal of
the member. In the case of any vacancy, a special election must be held as outlined in Article VII.
12. All Judiciary members must abide by these rules and procedures or be removed from the Judiciary.
Article VI – Measures Governing Behavior
The price of freedom is responsibility embodied by self-restraint and obligation. Regulations are put forth by the
Administration, the Faculty, and the Students to maintain the community’s values and the balance of freedom and
responsibility. The specific regulations can be found in the Reed-N-Heed.
I. Administrative Policies
Administrative policies are limited to issues deemed particularly significant by the Director. They are related to the
advancement of the school’s mission and the protection of the school’s good name. The development of these policies is
the responsibility of the Director alone.
II. Faculty Policies
Faculty policies are the rules and policies deemed to be significant by the Faculty. In general, they are concerned with
the school’s operation and the safety and well being of the student body. While the Faculty has the final say in the
development of Faculty Policy, students have the right to propose any revisions they see fit. Any Faculty member may
propose an amendment to the Faculty Policy. The proposed alteration is taken to the Faculty to be voted on. The
Administration may veto a proposed policy.
Note to Sections I and II:
The Administration and Faculty pledge to hear student opinion relating to the formulation of policies
that concern students, but they reserve the right to make decisions independent of the majority
opinion of students. While the Administration and Faculty are obligated to explain to the students the
reasoning behind actions taken, students’ opinions do not affect a policy’s introduction into the
Read-N-Heed.
III. Student Standards
In keeping with a commitment to the widest possible student participation in government, the Faculty shall designate
realms of the school-community in which students shall be free to govern as described in the Read-N-Heed. Such areas are
intended to develop in students a sense of duty in the exercise of freedom. The designation of Student Standards assumes
close cooperation between Faculty and Students. Students should only petition the Faculty for such designation after sufficient
prior cooperative thinking and planning by representatives of the Faculty and Council. Both Faculty and Students are
responsible for creating a favorable and supportive atmosphere when Students petition to claim a standard. The Faculty shall
refrain from transferring a Faculty Policy to Students unless there is evidence of widespread desire on the part of Students to
undertake responsible management of that area. There should be ongoing discussion between Faculty and Students regarding
the management of an assumed Standard. Faculty may not mandate changes in Standards or in Student enforcement
procedures of the Standards. It is the Faculty’s duty to re-assume control of a Student Standard if students fail to show
responsibility in their governance of that area. In withdrawing a designation of a Student Standard, the Faculty will give its
reasons first to the Council, and then to the Town Meeting, but there is no implication of a right to veto by either group.
The preferred means of enforcement of all Student Standards is persuasion, which if ineffective, may be followed by
a Record as outlined in Article V.
Student Standards are formulated by the following procedure:
Students should initiate an inquiry into the possibility of assuming responsibility for an area, or Faculty may encourage
students to assume responsibility for an area. Any student, in consultation with any member of the school-community they
choose, writes a proposal for standards or revisions to be implemented in the area in question. Faculty may also propose
changes to existing standards. There will be small group discussions of the proposed standards and means of enforcement.
The final proposal is then submitted to and reviewed by the Council. The Council will then hold a vote. If the proposed
revision passes the Council, the revisions will then be voted on in a Faculty meeting. Representatives from the Council should
attend the Faculty meeting in order to maintain thorough communication. If it passes the Faculty, the proposed Standards
must be presented in a Town Meeting and voted on for final approval. For the amendment to pass the Council, Faculty, and
Town Meeting, the revisions must have a two-thirds majority support of each. If the consultation procedure does not produce
widespread commitment to the proposal on the part of students, the Mayor will remand the matter to the originating group for
further consideration.
At the beginning of the school year, the Council should review existing standards and present them to the Town
Meeting (or to small groups) for consideration and possible revision. Standards of the preceding year are in effect until this
is done.
Article VII – Elections
In order for a democracy to survive, it must be self-perpetuating through the orderly and fair transition of power by
means of open elections.
1. Elections for the Council and the Judiciary will be held biannually near the end of each semester.
2. Only students are allowed to vote in elections. Every student, regardless of circumstance, is allowed and encouraged
to vote.
3. The Faculty has no input in who is allowed to run. Any student may run for a position regardless of circumstance.
4. In order to run for a public office, students must petition. The Council will specify and publicize the nature of the
petition for each office. Petitions for Mayor and Commissions must include platforms and signatures as defined
in Article IV and the Council is responsible for making all platforms public.
5. While students may run for only one office in the Council, they are permitted to run for the Judiciary in addition to an
office in the Council.
6. Each candidate is entrusted with using their best judgment in carrying out a campaign, should they choose to have
one. All campaign material must be appropriate and aimed at positively portraying a candidate rather than negatively
portraying a competitor. The Council may vote to disqualify a candidate who has deviated from these requirements.
7. A special Town Meeting will be held prior to each election day in which candidates may make speeches presenting their
platforms. The Council will administer this Town Meeting and make public the agenda thereof before the meeting.
8. Voting will be by secret ballot after the special Town Meeting. The Council must determine the optimal method to
conduct a fair and impartial voting process, which should be made public before voting commences. The Council
may appoint other students and Faculty members to assist them.
9. The Council will tally the votes and may appoint other students and Faculty members to assist them. The numerical
statistics are to be kept completely confidential, with only the results of the election posted and not the number of
votes each candidate received.
10. Election is by an Alternative Vote. Voters will be given the option to rank the candidates in order of First Choice,
Second Choice, etc. If the candidate with the highest number of First Choice votes obtains a majority, they win the
election. If said candidate does not receive a majority of all votes cast, the candidate with the lowest number of
First Option votes will drop out and their votes will transfer to each respective voter’s Second Choice. This process
will repeat automatically until there is a clear majority winner.
11. If less than three-quarters of the student body participates in the election, there will be a re-election. Elections for
the Commission of Boarding will require three-quarters participation from the boarding student community.
12. No candidate for an election may assist in the election process. Therefore, Council members who plan to run in the
election may neither participate in decisions that the Council makes concerning the election nor assist in
administering the voting or counting.
13. The Council must choose the members who are primarily responsible for conducting the election process. Usually,
this duty is allotted to either the Commission of Citizenship or the Commission of Protection. However, if students
holding both Commissions plan to run for office, the Council must elect two impartial council members to run the
election.
14. In the case of a vacancy in the offices of the Mayor or the Commissions, the Town Meeting must decide by a two
thirds majority vote whether or not the vacancy should be filled. In the case of a vacancy in the offices of the
Class Representatives, the relevant Class Meeting will decide by a two-thirds majority vote whether or not the
vacancy should be filled. If it is decided that a vacancy should be filled, the normal election procedure will take
place. If a vacancy should arise in the Judiciary, the vacancy must be filled by a special election.
Article VIII – Impeachment of Elected Officials
Any member of the Indian Springs school-community can suggest the impeachment of an elected student official.
There are separate processes for the impeachment and removal of students from various offices.
I. Students holding the offices of the Council may be accused and impeached by the following process:
1. The accuser must present the proposal of impeachment to the Judiciary, either in person or in writing, giving specific
reasons for impeachment. The accuser has the option to remain anonymous.
2. The Judiciary will install the Student Recorder as the Impeachment Recorder to record the arguments and proceedings
of the impeachment trial. If the Student Recorder is unable to be impartial, another member of the Judiciary may be
elected by majority vote to be the Impeachment Recorder.
3. The Judiciary can decide on the manner in which to conduct the trial but must hear both the accuser’s and the
accused’s arguments. Based on the trial, the Judiciary will decide by majority vote whether or not the
proposed impeachment should continue to the Town Meeting or the Class Meeting.
4. If the Judiciary decides to advance the impeachment case of a Class Representative, then the case will go to the
respective Class Meeting. Cases for all other Council offices will advance to the Town Meeting. The proceedings in
the preliminary stages (outlined in a, b, and c) are to remain completely confidential even after the Town Meeting
or the Class Meeting, if one is held. Only the information and arguments that the Judiciary deems important
enough for the Impeachment Recorder to present in public meetings may be disclosed, in the case of a Town
Meeting or Class Meeting. Only the Impeachment Recorder may present such information.
5. The Impeachment Recorder must make a presentation to the Town Meeting if the accused is a Mayor or
Commissioner, or to the Class Meeting if the accused is a Class Representative. This presentation should include the
accusations against the official and the accused official’s defense in an equal and unbiased manner. Students in the
Town Meeting or Class Meeting will then vote by secret ballot on whether or not to remove the impeached official
from office. If the impeachment passes the Town Meeting or Class Meeting by a two-thirds majority, the official will
be removed from office immediately.
6. The vacancy procedure outlined in Article VII will determine whether or not a special election will be held.
II. Students holding chairs on the Judiciary may be accused and impeached by the following process:
1. The accuser must present the proposal of impeachment to the Council, either in person or in writing, giving specific
reasons for impeachment. The accuser has the option to remain anonymous.
2. The Council must elect by majority vote an impartial member of the Council to be the Impeachment Recorder to record
the arguments and proceedings of the impeachment trial.
3. The Council can decide on the manner in which to conduct the trial but must hear both the accuser’s and the accused’s
arguments. Based on the trial, the Council will decide by a two-thirds majority vote whether or not the proposed
impeachment should continue to the Town Meeting.
4. The proceedings in the preliminary stages (outlined in a, b, and c) are to remain completely confidential even after the
Town Meeting, if one is held. Only the information and arguments that the Council deems important enough for the
Impeachment Recorder to present in a public meeting may be disclosed, in the case of a Town Meeting. Only the
Impeachment Recorder may present such information.
5. The Impeachment Recorder must present the accusations against the official and the defenses of the accused to the
Town Meeting in an equal and unbiased manner. Students will then vote by secret ballot on whether or not to
remove the impeached official from office. If the impeachment passes the Town Meeting by a two-thirds majority,
the official will be removed from office immediately.
6. In the case that a Judiciary member is impeached, there must be a special election to fill the vacancy.
Article IX – Amendments
Provided that every member of the school-community has the power and obligation to improve it through constructive
change, any person may submit a proposal to amend the Constitution at any time during the academic year. The proposed
amendment must first be submitted to and reviewed by the Council. The Council will hold a vote. If the proposed
amendment passes the Council, the revisions will then go to a Faculty meeting to be voted on. Representatives from the
Council should attend the Faculty meeting in order to maintain thorough communication. If it passes the Faculty, the
revisions must be presented in a Town Meeting and voted on for final approval. For the amendment to pass the Council,
Faculty, and Town
Meeting, the revisions must have two-thirds majority support of each. If at any point significant revisions are made to
an amendment, the process will begin again with the Council’s review.
The Indian Springs School Constitution
Preamble
Under the freedom granted the faculty and students of Indian Springs School by the Board of Governors of the
Alabama Educational Foundation, the governing body of Indian Springs School, there is herewith created the official Indian
Springs School Constitution.
The purpose of the Indian Springs School Constitution and Government is to promote living and learning in accordance

ethical development of all members of the Indian Springs school-community.
In establishing this Constitution, the members of the Indian Springs school-community affirm that students and teachers
do not have to accept themselves or their surroundings as they are but that it is within their power to improve both through
participation in constructive change. Such participation enhances the worth and dignity of humankind, develops responsibility,
and leads persons to the realization of latent powers.
Article I – School-Community Life
The school-community exists for the purpose of providing an environment in which each individual can develop to his
or her full stature.
I. Rights
Each individual has certain rights that are equal for each person. Individuals are guaranteed maximum freedom so long

This Constitution guarantees:
1. The right to freedom of religion, speech, inquiry, and criticism.
2. The right of students to select representatives in the government.
3. The right of students to run for public office.
4. The right to petition the Council or Faculty.
5. The right to assemble peacefully.

II. Values and Ideals
Certain values and ideals are prized because they contribute to making the school-community a better place in which to

In our school-community, we aspire to:
1. Show respect towards the opinions and beliefs of others.
2. Develop genuine friendships.
3. Respect the worth and dignity of the individual.
4. Widen the area of common agreement by which decisions are made and actions taken.

8. Reflect disapproval of behavior wherein one individual does or says things harmful to another or to the good name of
the school.
9. Prohibit any organized group that divides or tends to divide the school-community.

7. Evaluate the school-community continuously in an effort to improve it.
Article II – Structure of the Government
The divisions of government are:
1. The Director of Indian Springs School, who is appointed by the Board of Governors.
2. The Administration.
3. The Faculty.
4. The Student Government:
a. Town Meeting: a legislative body comprised of all students that, second to the Administration and Faculty, is the
authority of government at Indian Springs.
b. Council: an executive body comprised of the Mayor, the Commissions, and the Class Representatives. c.
Judiciary: a judicial body comprised of students who hear and rule on infractions of policies, rules, and standards.
Article III – Town Meeting
The heart of the Government at Indian Springs School is the Town Meeting. Town Meeting is open to all citizens and
has three main functions:
1. The Town Meeting serves as the legislative branch of Government and is the final authority on all issues in which the
Faculty is neutral. While the Town Meeting is open to all citizens, only students are allowed to vote. Three-quarters
of the student body constitutes a quorum. Decisions will be made by at least a two-thirds majority vote. The
presiding officer will determine whether the voting will be secret or public.
2. The Town Meeting serves as an open forum in which students can freely voice their concerns and opinions about
pressing issues in an effort to improve the overall quality of life in the school-community.
3. The Town Meeting is a means of communication among all citizens of the school-community. Because a democracy
cannot survive unless its citizens remain consistently informed, weekly meetings are encouraged; however, the
frequency of meetings is determined by need.
Town Meetings are called either by the Mayor with the consent of the Faculty or by the Faculty. Students have the right to
request to have a Town Meeting either through the Council, Faculty, or Director. The Mayor has the right to call a
students-only Town Meeting.
The presiding officer of the Town Meeting is the Mayor. In the absence of the Mayor, the Council will designate a presiding
officer. However, if the Town Meeting is called by the Faculty, the Director or someone designated by the Faculty may take
charge of the meeting.
Article IV – The Council
The Council is a body of students elected entirely by the students for the purpose of providing leadership in the
community. The most important responsibility of the Council is to assess the quality of school-community life and improve it
on as many levels as possible.
I. The offices of the Council are:
1. The Mayor, whose duty is to provide leadership for the Council and the community as a whole in building a greater
understanding of the aims and purposes of the community and to bring about the realization of these aims and
purposes through the various Council offices. The Mayor is responsible for seeing that each Council office fulfills
its respective duties and platforms and for coordinating the work of the Council.
2. Commission of Citizenship, whose duties are concerned with the continuing evaluation of the quality of citizenship as
exhibited on a day-to-day basis, in and out of the classroom, and in the larger community beyond the boundaries
of Indian Springs School. Specific examples can include, but are not limited to, organizing Development Day,
promoting service opportunities, and overseeing student clubs.
3. Commission of Education, whose duties are concerned with the continuing evaluation and improvement of teaching
and learning and of the conditions that influence the academic experience. Specific examples can include, but are
not limited to, managing the Writing Center, creating a student tutor system, and participating in Academics
Committee meetings.
4. Commission of Protection, whose duties are concerned with the enforcement of the standards of the school-community
and the promotion of environmental protection. Specific examples can include, but are not limited to, reporting
attendance at mandatory meetings and issuing Records for unexcused absences at such meetings, organizing and
carrying out campus recycling, and discouraging littering, and managing matters surrounding the American flag(s)
flown on campus. Members of the commission are, in a special sense, guardians of the rights, values, principles, and
ideals set out in this Constitution. The preferred method of enforcement of such standards is persuasion. However,
where persuasion does not prove successful, the commission may take more stringent measures.
5. Commission of Recreation, whose duties are concerned with the continuing evaluation and improvement of wholesome
recreational activities in the school-community. Specific examples can include, but are not limited to, organizing
school dances, planning Winter Formal, and leading activities that promote school spirit.
6. Commission of Services, whose duties are concerned with the continuing evaluation and improvement of the range of
needed services in the school-community. The most evident example of this duty is the operation of the student
store.
7. Commission of Boarding, whose duties are concerned with the continuing evaluation and improvement of dormitory
life, which involves the facilitation and execution of dormitory administration such as maintenance and rule
enforcement. The Commission is to be elected from and by the boarding student community as outlined in Article VII.
8. Deputies, who are students installed by a specific Commission to aid in the execution of its duties and to expand
community participation in Government. Each Commission may have up to three Deputies, with the exception of
Commissioners of Boarding, who may have up to two deputies in each dormitory. No one in any of the Council
offices may become a Deputy, and Deputies may serve only one Commission. Deputies are nominated by the
Commission and must be approved individually by the Council. The Commission or the Council may remove a Deputy
at any time; when a Commission leaves office, the Deputies of that Commission also leave their posts. Deputies do
not have a vote in the Council but are strongly encouraged to attend Council meetings.
9. Class Representatives, whose duties are concerned with the continuing evaluation of opinions and desires of their
respective classes. Class Representatives are responsible for organizing and voicing class concerns to the Council
and for taking attendance for their respective grades at mandatory meetings. Each class will elect one or two
representatives from its own class and for its own class.
10. The Council Secretary, whose duties are concerned with the documentation and communication of recent plans,
updates, and discussions mentioned during Student Government and Town Meetings and contributing to task
management within the Council. Specific examples can include, but are not limited to, taking notes during Council
meetings, taking notes during Town Meetings, and assisting the Mayor in certain projects. These notes must be
reviewed and approved by the Council before their release. The Council Secretary does not have a vote in the
Council. The Council Secretary is nominated by the Mayor and must be approved individually by the Council through a
⅔majority vote.
II. Additional responsibilities of the Council:
1. Each office of the Council must prepare a written platform, a program of action to be implemented during the specified
term of office. This platform should present the goals and methodology for the office.
2. The Council should hold regular meetings to discuss and evaluate ongoing programs. The meetings are compulsory for
all members unless a viable excuse is given. Embracing the principles of democracy, all members of the school
community are encouraged to attend Council meetings.
3. The Council must, at times, make decisions on items such as those called for in this Constitution. In order to make
these decisions, the Council must vote. Three-quarters of the Council constitutes a quorum, and decisions will be
made by a two-thirds majority vote.
4. The Council must administer elections at the end of each semester, as outlined in Article VII.
5. The Mayor has final responsibility for the effectiveness of the Council, and the Director of Indian Springs School has
final responsibility for the effectiveness of the Faculty Liaisons, which are mentor Faculty members assigned to
each Commission and Class. It is the duty of the Mayor and Director to see that the Commissions and Liaisons
develop a unified program in order to improve specific aspects of the school-community from the vantage point of
a comprehensive view of school-community problems.
Article V – The Judiciary
The Indian Springs School Judiciary is a panel elected entirely by the students for the purpose of hearing and ruling on
infractions of policies, rules, and standards within the school-community. The Judiciary is composed of eleven students and
one Faculty Liaison. The eleven-member panel must be composed of one 8th (for the second semester only), one 9th, one
10th, one 11th, and one 12th grader as well as two boarding students, elected by popular vote by the entire student body.
Once these stipulations have been met, the remaining spots will be filled by those receiving the highest number of votes. Any
student who wishes to run for the Judiciary is both welcome and encouraged to do so. The Faculty has no input regarding
who is allowed to run.
I. Offices of Judiciary
There are two offices of Judiciary: the Head of Judiciary and the Student Recorder. Both positions are elected at the first
Judiciary meeting following general elections by a combined panel of incoming and outgoing members of the Judiciary. Voting
is anonymous, and offices are decided by majority vote.
1. The Head of Judiciary is the leader of the panel and serves as a guide and moderator during discussions rather than a
member advocating their own opinions. The Head of Judiciary has no vote during regular meetings except in the case of a tie,
where they serve as a tiebreaker. In order to run for Head of Judiciary, a student must have previously served at least one
term on the panel, if there is such a person. The Head of Judiciary is responsible for organizing meeting times, bringing a
copy of the Read ‘n’ Heed, Records, and precedents to every meeting, taking attendance at meetings, and notifying the
accused of the accused offense as well as the date, time, and location of the hearing. After each hearing, it is the Head’s
responsibility to provide the Dean of Student Life with a report of all cases, rulings, and work hours or other punishments
given.
2. The Student Recorder keeps an accurate record of the decisions made by the Judiciary and serves as the
Impeachment Recorder during the impeachment of a Council member as outlined in Article VIII. In the event of the Head of
Judiciary receiving a Record, the Student Recorder assumes the role of Head of Judiciary for that case.
II. The Faculty Liaison
The Faculty Liaison to the Judiciary is the Faculty’s representation on the panel. They serve only as a guide; students
maintain the primary responsibility and control of the Judiciary. The Faculty Liaison may voice an opinion, act as a clarifier
and interpreter of the rules, and assist in interrogating the accused. They may not vote during regular meetings or during
the election of offices. The Faculty Liaison is responsible for creating a written memo of all proceedings of the Judiciary to
distribute to the Director, the Dean of Academics, the Dean of Student Life, and the Dean of Residential Life. The Faculty
Liaison is expected to abide by all policies, rules, and procedures of the Judiciary.
III. The Dean of Student Life
The Dean of Student Life is not a member of the Judiciary and is not present during meetings; they serve as an outside
assistant in executing the administrative duties of the Judiciary. After each meeting, an outline of all decisions, including a
breakdown of the work hours and/or other punishments and their corresponding offenses, is given to the Dean of Student
Life by the Head of Judiciary. The Dean of Student Life is responsible for notifying each student and their Faculty Advisor of
the work hour assignment and/or other punishment given by the Judiciary. It is the Dean of Student Life’s responsibility to
keep track of work hours performed and time frames for other punishments for each student. When a Faculty member
submits a record, they are to be informed of the case’s outcome by the Dean of Student Life.
IV. Judiciary Procedure
Persuasion is the primary means of enforcement of the rules in the school-community. However, acknowledging that a
warning may not alter behavior in all situations, a Record may be issued after persuasion has been attempted. Any member of
the community may write a Record to report a rule infraction. Records are submitted to the Head of Judiciary through email.
In the Record, the accuser should provide a detailed written explanation of the situation along with any other relevant
information. If there is not enough information from the accuser to prove guilt, the accused should be deemed innocent. Prior
to the
hearing, the Head of Judiciary may ask the accuser if there is more information associated with the record. The responsibility
for providing details falls on the accuser in order for the Judiciary to remain the jury rather than the prosecutor. The accuser
may choose to remain anonymous during the proceedings of the hearing. The accuser should provide all relevant information
in the original record, but may request to attend the hearing if he or she would like to provide additional information. When a
Record is submitted, the Head will alert the Judiciary, the accused, and the accuser (when necessary) of the date, time, and
location of the hearing. Meetings should be called as regularly as possible. Six members of the Judiciary other than the Head
must be present to constitute a quorum.
The accused must appear before the Judiciary on the specified day. If the accused does not do so and does not provide a
viable excuse, they will automatically be given a set punishment. On the day of the hearing, the Head will read the Record
aloud and explain the case to the Judiciary. The Judiciary will then summon and question the accused concerning all aspects
of the case and any connected incidents. Upon completion, the accused will leave the room. Only the eleven members of the
Judiciary and the Faculty Liaison are allowed to be present during deliberation. The panel must first determine if the accused is
innocent or guilty. The accused is considered innocent until proven guilty. If the accused is deemed guilty, the precedent
system—a written record of past rule infractions and their correlating punishments—will be used as a guide during the
deliberation of punishment. However, due to the uniqueness of each case, the precedent system should not necessarily be
followed. Finally, the Judiciary will set a punishment by majority vote. If at any point during the process the Judiciary
determines it has inadequate information, the panel reserves the right to postpone a case until more information has been
gathered from relevant parties. The accused may also be summoned for additional questioning for clarification.
On the following school day, the accused must report to the Dean of Student Life to receive their punishment. If work
hours were assigned, the accused must then contact the appropriate adult to establish a schedule for the completion of the
work hours. If the work hours are not completed within the set time period, the accused will be charged with “work hour
delinquency,” and the uncompleted number of hours shall be doubled automatically. If the accused vehemently maintains their
innocence yet is given work hours, they have the right to formally submit an appeal by email to the Judiciary. After the Dean
of Student Life and the Director are notified of the petition, the Judiciary will hold another hearing to reexamine evidence and
question relevant parties.
Strict confidentiality must be maintained throughout the entire Judiciary process.
V. Judiciary Rules
1. All Judiciary members and the Faculty Liaison must act with seriousness of purpose, maintain respectful conduct, and
lead by example. This is of the utmost importance to the effectiveness of the Judiciary, which must maintain the
respect of the community to function properly.
2. All Judiciary members have equal say and power regardless of age or experience.
3. Those hearing the case and receiving summary memos must maintain the confidentiality of all proceedings and
outcomes. There will be no discussion of the decision-making process in front of the accused. Only the accused has
the right to discuss the Judiciary’s decision; it is that person’s decision alone to discuss their case.
4. If a Judiciary member is responsible for issuing a record, that member will not vote on that case or be present for its
deliberation.
5. If a Judiciary member receives a Record, that member may not be present during the deliberation of the case.
6. Personal bias of any kind against anyone may not affect the vote or discussion of a case. If a panel member feels
unable to ignore a bias, they should recuse themselves from the case.
7. If the accused is found guilty of breaking a rule, even if members of the Judiciary disagree with the rule, the Judiciary
must punish it accordingly.
8. The Judiciary is responsible for punishing any rule infractions that are uncovered during a hearing.
9. The Judiciary must meet at least once per term for a self-evaluation and discussion of any necessary changes to these
rules and the procedures herein.
10. The Judiciary may not assign cruel or unusual punishments.
11. Judiciary members are expected to attend every meeting. A member is allowed one unexcused absence before
being removed from the panel. A member is allowed four excused absences. At the fourth absence, if the absences
are deemed disruptive to the panel’s functioning, the Head of Judiciary will conduct a vote regarding the removal of
the member. In the case of any vacancy, a special election must be held as outlined in Article VII.
12. All Judiciary members must abide by these rules and procedures or be removed from the Judiciary.
Article VI – Measures Governing Behavior
The price of freedom is responsibility embodied by self-restraint and obligation. Regulations are put forth by the
Administration, the Faculty, and the Students to maintain the community’s values and the balance of freedom and
responsibility. The specific regulations can be found in the Reed-N-Heed.
I. Administrative Policies
Administrative policies are limited to issues deemed particularly significant by the Director. They are related to the
advancement of the school’s mission and the protection of the school’s good name. The development of these policies is
the responsibility of the Director alone.
II. Faculty Policies
Faculty policies are the rules and policies deemed to be significant by the Faculty. In general, they are concerned with
the school’s operation and the safety and well being of the student body. While the Faculty has the final say in the
development of Faculty Policy, students have the right to propose any revisions they see fit. Any Faculty member may
propose an amendment to the Faculty Policy. The proposed alteration is taken to the Faculty to be voted on. The
Administration may veto a proposed policy.
Note to Sections I and II:
The Administration and Faculty pledge to hear student opinion relating to the formulation of policies
that concern students, but they reserve the right to make decisions independent of the majority
opinion of students. While the Administration and Faculty are obligated to explain to the students the
reasoning behind actions taken, students’ opinions do not affect a policy’s introduction into the
Read-N-Heed.
III. Student Standards
In keeping with a commitment to the widest possible student participation in government, the Faculty shall designate
realms of the school-community in which students shall be free to govern as described in the Read-N-Heed. Such areas are
intended to develop in students a sense of duty in the exercise of freedom. The designation of Student Standards assumes
close cooperation between Faculty and Students. Students should only petition the Faculty for such designation after sufficient
prior cooperative thinking and planning by representatives of the Faculty and Council. Both Faculty and Students are
responsible for creating a favorable and supportive atmosphere when Students petition to claim a standard. The Faculty shall
refrain from transferring a Faculty Policy to Students unless there is evidence of widespread desire on the part of Students to
undertake responsible management of that area. There should be ongoing discussion between Faculty and Students regarding
the management of an assumed Standard. Faculty may not mandate changes in Standards or in Student enforcement
procedures of the Standards. It is the Faculty’s duty to re-assume control of a Student Standard if students fail to show
responsibility in their governance of that area. In withdrawing a designation of a Student Standard, the Faculty will give its
reasons first to the Council, and then to the Town Meeting, but there is no implication of a right to veto by either group.
The preferred means of enforcement of all Student Standards is persuasion, which if ineffective, may be followed by
a Record as outlined in Article V.
Student Standards are formulated by the following procedure:
Students should initiate an inquiry into the possibility of assuming responsibility for an area, or Faculty may encourage
students to assume responsibility for an area. Any student, in consultation with any member of the school-community they
choose, writes a proposal for standards or revisions to be implemented in the area in question. Faculty may also propose
changes to existing standards. There will be small group discussions of the proposed standards and means of enforcement.
The final proposal is then submitted to and reviewed by the Council. The Council will then hold a vote. If the proposed
revision passes the Council, the revisions will then be voted on in a Faculty meeting. Representatives from the Council should
attend the Faculty meeting in order to maintain thorough communication. If it passes the Faculty, the proposed Standards
must be presented in a Town Meeting and voted on for final approval. For the amendment to pass the Council, Faculty, and
Town Meeting, the revisions must have a two-thirds majority support of each. If the consultation procedure does not produce
widespread commitment to the proposal on the part of students, the Mayor will remand the matter to the originating group for
further consideration.
At the beginning of the school year, the Council should review existing standards and present them to the Town
Meeting (or to small groups) for consideration and possible revision. Standards of the preceding year are in effect until this
is done.
Article VII – Elections
In order for a democracy to survive, it must be self-perpetuating through the orderly and fair transition of power by
means of open elections.
1. Elections for the Council and the Judiciary will be held biannually near the end of each semester.
2. Only students are allowed to vote in elections. Every student, regardless of circumstance, is allowed and encouraged
to vote.
3. The Faculty has no input in who is allowed to run. Any student may run for a position regardless of circumstance.
4. In order to run for a public office, students must petition. The Council will specify and publicize the nature of the
petition for each office. Petitions for Mayor and Commissions must include platforms and signatures as defined
in Article IV and the Council is responsible for making all platforms public.
5. While students may run for only one office in the Council, they are permitted to run for the Judiciary in addition to an
office in the Council.
6. Each candidate is entrusted with using their best judgment in carrying out a campaign, should they choose to have
one. All campaign material must be appropriate and aimed at positively portraying a candidate rather than negatively
portraying a competitor. The Council may vote to disqualify a candidate who has deviated from these requirements.
7. A special Town Meeting will be held prior to each election day in which candidates may make speeches presenting their
platforms. The Council will administer this Town Meeting and make public the agenda thereof before the meeting.
8. Voting will be by secret ballot after the special Town Meeting. The Council must determine the optimal method to
conduct a fair and impartial voting process, which should be made public before voting commences. The Council
may appoint other students and Faculty members to assist them.
9. The Council will tally the votes and may appoint other students and Faculty members to assist them. The numerical
statistics are to be kept completely confidential, with only the results of the election posted and not the number of
votes each candidate received.
10. Election is by an Alternative Vote. Voters will be given the option to rank the candidates in order of First Choice,
Second Choice, etc. If the candidate with the highest number of First Choice votes obtains a majority, they win the
election. If said candidate does not receive a majority of all votes cast, the candidate with the lowest number of
First Option votes will drop out and their votes will transfer to each respective voter’s Second Choice. This process
will repeat automatically until there is a clear majority winner.
11. If less than three-quarters of the student body participates in the election, there will be a re-election. Elections for
the Commission of Boarding will require three-quarters participation from the boarding student community.
12. No candidate for an election may assist in the election process. Therefore, Council members who plan to run in the
election may neither participate in decisions that the Council makes concerning the election nor assist in
administering the voting or counting.
13. The Council must choose the members who are primarily responsible for conducting the election process. Usually,
this duty is allotted to either the Commission of Citizenship or the Commission of Protection. However, if students
holding both Commissions plan to run for office, the Council must elect two impartial council members to run the
election.
14. In the case of a vacancy in the offices of the Mayor or the Commissions, the Town Meeting must decide by a two
thirds majority vote whether or not the vacancy should be filled. In the case of a vacancy in the offices of the
Class Representatives, the relevant Class Meeting will decide by a two-thirds majority vote whether or not the
vacancy should be filled. If it is decided that a vacancy should be filled, the normal election procedure will take
place. If a vacancy should arise in the Judiciary, the vacancy must be filled by a special election.
Article VIII – Impeachment of Elected Officials
Any member of the Indian Springs school-community can suggest the impeachment of an elected student official.
There are separate processes for the impeachment and removal of students from various offices.
I. Students holding the offices of the Council may be accused and impeached by the following process:
1. The accuser must present the proposal of impeachment to the Judiciary, either in person or in writing, giving specific
reasons for impeachment. The accuser has the option to remain anonymous.
2. The Judiciary will install the Student Recorder as the Impeachment Recorder to record the arguments and proceedings
of the impeachment trial. If the Student Recorder is unable to be impartial, another member of the Judiciary may be
elected by majority vote to be the Impeachment Recorder.
3. The Judiciary can decide on the manner in which to conduct the trial but must hear both the accuser’s and the
accused’s arguments. Based on the trial, the Judiciary will decide by majority vote whether or not the
proposed impeachment should continue to the Town Meeting or the Class Meeting.
4. If the Judiciary decides to advance the impeachment case of a Class Representative, then the case will go to the
respective Class Meeting. Cases for all other Council offices will advance to the Town Meeting. The proceedings in
the preliminary stages (outlined in a, b, and c) are to remain completely confidential even after the Town Meeting
or the Class Meeting, if one is held. Only the information and arguments that the Judiciary deems important
enough for the Impeachment Recorder to present in public meetings may be disclosed, in the case of a Town
Meeting or Class Meeting. Only the Impeachment Recorder may present such information.
5. The Impeachment Recorder must make a presentation to the Town Meeting if the accused is a Mayor or
Commissioner, or to the Class Meeting if the accused is a Class Representative. This presentation should include the
accusations against the official and the accused official’s defense in an equal and unbiased manner. Students in the
Town Meeting or Class Meeting will then vote by secret ballot on whether or not to remove the impeached official
from office. If the impeachment passes the Town Meeting or Class Meeting by a two-thirds majority, the official will
be removed from office immediately.
6. The vacancy procedure outlined in Article VII will determine whether or not a special election will be held.
II. Students holding chairs on the Judiciary may be accused and impeached by the following process:
1. The accuser must present the proposal of impeachment to the Council, either in person or in writing, giving specific
reasons for impeachment. The accuser has the option to remain anonymous.
2. The Council must elect by majority vote an impartial member of the Council to be the Impeachment Recorder to record
the arguments and proceedings of the impeachment trial.
3. The Council can decide on the manner in which to conduct the trial but must hear both the accuser’s and the accused’s
arguments. Based on the trial, the Council will decide by a two-thirds majority vote whether or not the proposed
impeachment should continue to the Town Meeting.
4. The proceedings in the preliminary stages (outlined in a, b, and c) are to remain completely confidential even after the
Town Meeting, if one is held. Only the information and arguments that the Council deems important enough for the
Impeachment Recorder to present in a public meeting may be disclosed, in the case of a Town Meeting. Only the
Impeachment Recorder may present such information.
5. The Impeachment Recorder must present the accusations against the official and the defenses of the accused to the
Town Meeting in an equal and unbiased manner. Students will then vote by secret ballot on whether or not to
remove the impeached official from office. If the impeachment passes the Town Meeting by a two-thirds majority,
the official will be removed from office immediately.
6. In the case that a Judiciary member is impeached, there must be a special election to fill the vacancy.
Article IX – Amendments
Provided that every member of the school-community has the power and obligation to improve it through constructive
change, any person may submit a proposal to amend the Constitution at any time during the academic year. The proposed
amendment must first be submitted to and reviewed by the Council. The Council will hold a vote. If the proposed
amendment passes the Council, the revisions will then go to a Faculty meeting to be voted on. Representatives from the
Council should attend the Faculty meeting in order to maintain thorough communication. If it passes the Faculty, the
revisions must be presented in a Town Meeting and voted on for final approval. For the amendment to pass the Council,
Faculty, and Town
Meeting, the revisions must have two-thirds majority support of each. If at any point significant revisions are made to
an amendment, the process will begin again with the Council’s review.
The Indian Springs School Constitution
Preamble
Under the freedom granted the faculty and students of Indian Springs School by the Board of Governors of the
Alabama Educational Foundation, the governing body of Indian Springs School, there is herewith created the official Indian
Springs School Constitution.
The purpose of the Indian Springs School Constitution and Government is to promote living and learning in accordance
with humane and democratic values and principles, thereby contributing to the intellectual, physical, emotional, spiritual, and
ethical development of all members of the Indian Springs school-community.
In establishing this Constitution, the members of the Indian Springs school-community affirm that students and teachers
do not have to accept themselves or their surroundings as they are but that it is within their power to improve both through
participation in constructive change. Such participation enhances the worth and dignity of humankind, develops responsibility,
and leads persons to the realization of latent powers.
Article I – School-Community Life
The school-community exists for the purpose of providing an environment in which each individual can develop to his
or her full stature.
I. Rights
Each individual has certain rights that are equal for each person. Individuals are guaranteed maximum freedom so long
as they do not infringe upon the rights of others or threaten the general welfare of the school-community.
This Constitution guarantees:
1. The right to freedom of religion, speech, inquiry, and criticism.
2. The right of students to select representatives in the government.
3. The right of students to run for public office.
4. The right to petition the Council or Faculty.
5. The right to assemble peacefully.
6. The right to be considered innocent until proven guilty.
II. Values and Ideals
Certain values and ideals are prized because they contribute to making the school-community a better place in which to
live and learn. Each individual is responsible for working toward the realization of these values and ideals.
In our school-community, we aspire to:
1. Show respect towards the opinions and beliefs of others.
2. Develop genuine friendships.
3. Respect the worth and dignity of the individual.
4. Widen the area of common agreement by which decisions are made and actions taken.
5. Develop personal integrity and moral courage.
6. Help individuals to develop their talents and skills.
7. Stimulate individuals to give direct, unselfish service to the school-community.
8. Reflect disapproval of behavior wherein one individual does or says things harmful to another or to the good name of
the school.
9. Prohibit any organized group that divides or tends to divide the school-community.
We encourage individuals to:
1. Accept their political responsibilities.
2. Keep informed about school-community jobs because the general welfare requires it.
3. Voice opinions and demands directly to the proper officials.
4. Use democratic methods to achieve group agreement.
5. Consider the common good before group or personal liberties.
6. Live in accordance with agreed-upon standards.
7. Evaluate the school-community continuously in an effort to improve it.
Article II – Structure of the Government
The divisions of government are:
1. The Director of Indian Springs School, who is appointed by the Board of Governors.
2. The Administration.
3. The Faculty.
4. The Student Government:
a. Town Meeting: a legislative body comprised of all students that, second to the Administration and Faculty, is the
authority of government at Indian Springs.
b. Council: an executive body comprised of the Mayor, the Commissions, and the Class Representatives. c.
Judiciary: a judicial body comprised of students who hear and rule on infractions of policies, rules, and standards.
Article III – Town Meeting
The heart of the Government at Indian Springs School is the Town Meeting. Town Meeting is open to all citizens and
has three main functions:
1. The Town Meeting serves as the legislative branch of Government and is the final authority on all issues in which the
Faculty is neutral. While the Town Meeting is open to all citizens, only students are allowed to vote. Three-quarters
of the student body constitutes a quorum. Decisions will be made by at least a two-thirds majority vote. The
presiding officer will determine whether the voting will be secret or public.
2. The Town Meeting serves as an open forum in which students can freely voice their concerns and opinions about
pressing issues in an effort to improve the overall quality of life in the school-community.
3. The Town Meeting is a means of communication among all citizens of the school-community. Because a democracy
cannot survive unless its citizens remain consistently informed, weekly meetings are encouraged; however, the
frequency of meetings is determined by need.
Town Meetings are called either by the Mayor with the consent of the Faculty or by the Faculty. Students have the right to
request to have a Town Meeting either through the Council, Faculty, or Director. The Mayor has the right to call a
students-only Town Meeting.
The presiding officer of the Town Meeting is the Mayor. In the absence of the Mayor, the Council will designate a presiding
officer. However, if the Town Meeting is called by the Faculty, the Director or someone designated by the Faculty may take
charge of the meeting.
Article IV – The Council
The Council is a body of students elected entirely by the students for the purpose of providing leadership in the
community. The most important responsibility of the Council is to assess the quality of school-community life and improve it
on as many levels as possible.
I. The offices of the Council are:
1. The Mayor, whose duty is to provide leadership for the Council and the community as a whole in building a greater
understanding of the aims and purposes of the community and to bring about the realization of these aims and
purposes through the various Council offices. The Mayor is responsible for seeing that each Council office fulfills
its respective duties and platforms and for coordinating the work of the Council.
2. Commission of Citizenship, whose duties are concerned with the continuing evaluation of the quality of citizenship as
exhibited on a day-to-day basis, in and out of the classroom, and in the larger community beyond the boundaries
of Indian Springs School. Specific examples can include, but are not limited to, organizing Development Day,
promoting service opportunities, and overseeing student clubs.
3. Commission of Education, whose duties are concerned with the continuing evaluation and improvement of teaching
and learning and of the conditions that influence the academic experience. Specific examples can include, but are
not limited to, managing the Writing Center, creating a student tutor system, and participating in Academics
Committee meetings.
4. Commission of Protection, whose duties are concerned with the enforcement of the standards of the school-community
and the promotion of environmental protection. Specific examples can include, but are not limited to, reporting
attendance at mandatory meetings and issuing Records for unexcused absences at such meetings, organizing and
carrying out campus recycling, and discouraging littering, and managing matters surrounding the American flag(s)
flown on campus. Members of the commission are, in a special sense, guardians of the rights, values, principles, and
ideals set out in this Constitution. The preferred method of enforcement of such standards is persuasion. However,
where persuasion does not prove successful, the commission may take more stringent measures.
5. Commission of Recreation, whose duties are concerned with the continuing evaluation and improvement of wholesome
recreational activities in the school-community. Specific examples can include, but are not limited to, organizing
school dances, planning Winter Formal, and leading activities that promote school spirit.
6. Commission of Services, whose duties are concerned with the continuing evaluation and improvement of the range of
needed services in the school-community. The most evident example of this duty is the operation of the student
store.
7. Commission of Boarding, whose duties are concerned with the continuing evaluation and improvement of dormitory
life, which involves the facilitation and execution of dormitory administration such as maintenance and rule
enforcement. The Commission is to be elected from and by the boarding student community as outlined in Article VII.
8. Deputies, who are students installed by a specific Commission to aid in the execution of its duties and to expand
community participation in Government. Each Commission may have up to three Deputies, with the exception of
Commissioners of Boarding, who may have up to two deputies in each dormitory. No one in any of the Council
offices may become a Deputy, and Deputies may serve only one Commission. Deputies are nominated by the
Commission and must be approved individually by the Council. The Commission or the Council may remove a Deputy
at any time; when a Commission leaves office, the Deputies of that Commission also leave their posts. Deputies do
not have a vote in the Council but are strongly encouraged to attend Council meetings.
9. Class Representatives, whose duties are concerned with the continuing evaluation of opinions and desires of their
respective classes. Class Representatives are responsible for organizing and voicing class concerns to the Council
and for taking attendance for their respective grades at mandatory meetings. Each class will elect one or two
representatives from its own class and for its own class.
10. The Council Secretary, whose duties are concerned with the documentation and communication of recent plans,
updates, and discussions mentioned during Student Government and Town Meetings and contributing to task
management within the Council. Specific examples can include, but are not limited to, taking notes during Council
meetings, taking notes during Town Meetings, and assisting the Mayor in certain projects. These notes must be
reviewed and approved by the Council before their release. The Council Secretary does not have a vote in the
Council. The Council Secretary is nominated by the Mayor and must be approved individually by the Council through a
⅔majority vote.
II. Additional responsibilities of the Council:
1. Each office of the Council must prepare a written platform, a program of action to be implemented during the specified
term of office. This platform should present the goals and methodology for the office.
2. The Council should hold regular meetings to discuss and evaluate ongoing programs. The meetings are compulsory for
all members unless a viable excuse is given. Embracing the principles of democracy, all members of the school
community are encouraged to attend Council meetings.
3. The Council must, at times, make decisions on items such as those called for in this Constitution. In order to make
these decisions, the Council must vote. Three-quarters of the Council constitutes a quorum, and decisions will be
made by a two-thirds majority vote.
4. The Council must administer elections at the end of each semester, as outlined in Article VII.
5. The Mayor has final responsibility for the effectiveness of the Council, and the Director of Indian Springs School has
final responsibility for the effectiveness of the Faculty Liaisons, which are mentor Faculty members assigned to
each Commission and Class. It is the duty of the Mayor and Director to see that the Commissions and Liaisons
develop a unified program in order to improve specific aspects of the school-community from the vantage point of
a comprehensive view of school-community problems.
Article V – The Judiciary
The Indian Springs School Judiciary is a panel elected entirely by the students for the purpose of hearing and ruling on
infractions of policies, rules, and standards within the school-community. The Judiciary is composed of eleven students and
one Faculty Liaison. The eleven-member panel must be composed of one 8th (for the second semester only), one 9th, one
10th, one 11th, and one 12th grader as well as two boarding students, elected by popular vote by the entire student body.
Once these stipulations have been met, the remaining spots will be filled by those receiving the highest number of votes. Any
student who wishes to run for the Judiciary is both welcome and encouraged to do so. The Faculty has no input regarding
who is allowed to run.
I. Offices of Judiciary
There are two offices of Judiciary: the Head of Judiciary and the Student Recorder. Both positions are elected at the first
Judiciary meeting following general elections by a combined panel of incoming and outgoing members of the Judiciary. Voting
is anonymous, and offices are decided by majority vote.
1. The Head of Judiciary is the leader of the panel and serves as a guide and moderator during discussions rather than a
member advocating their own opinions. The Head of Judiciary has no vote during regular meetings except in the case of a tie,
where they serve as a tiebreaker. In order to run for Head of Judiciary, a student must have previously served at least one
term on the panel, if there is such a person. The Head of Judiciary is responsible for organizing meeting times, bringing a
copy of the Read ‘n’ Heed, Records, and precedents to every meeting, taking attendance at meetings, and notifying the
accused of the accused offense as well as the date, time, and location of the hearing. After each hearing, it is the Head’s
responsibility to provide the Dean of Student Life with a report of all cases, rulings, and work hours or other punishments
given.
2. The Student Recorder keeps an accurate record of the decisions made by the Judiciary and serves as the
Impeachment Recorder during the impeachment of a Council member as outlined in Article VIII. In the event of the Head of
Judiciary receiving a Record, the Student Recorder assumes the role of Head of Judiciary for that case.
II. The Faculty Liaison
The Faculty Liaison to the Judiciary is the Faculty’s representation on the panel. They serve only as a guide; students
maintain the primary responsibility and control of the Judiciary. The Faculty Liaison may voice an opinion, act as a clarifier
and interpreter of the rules, and assist in interrogating the accused. They may not vote during regular meetings or during
the election of offices. The Faculty Liaison is responsible for creating a written memo of all proceedings of the Judiciary to
distribute to the Director, the Dean of Academics, the Dean of Student Life, and the Dean of Residential Life. The Faculty
Liaison is expected to abide by all policies, rules, and procedures of the Judiciary.
III. The Dean of Student Life
The Dean of Student Life is not a member of the Judiciary and is not present during meetings; they serve as an outside
assistant in executing the administrative duties of the Judiciary. After each meeting, an outline of all decisions, including a
breakdown of the work hours and/or other punishments and their corresponding offenses, is given to the Dean of Student
Life by the Head of Judiciary. The Dean of Student Life is responsible for notifying each student and their Faculty Advisor of
the work hour assignment and/or other punishment given by the Judiciary. It is the Dean of Student Life’s responsibility to
keep track of work hours performed and time frames for other punishments for each student. When a Faculty member
submits a record, they are to be informed of the case’s outcome by the Dean of Student Life.
IV. Judiciary Procedure
Persuasion is the primary means of enforcement of the rules in the school-community. However, acknowledging that a
warning may not alter behavior in all situations, a Record may be issued after persuasion has been attempted. Any member of
the community may write a Record to report a rule infraction. Records are submitted to the Head of Judiciary through email.
In the Record, the accuser should provide a detailed written explanation of the situation along with any other relevant
information. If there is not enough information from the accuser to prove guilt, the accused should be deemed innocent. Prior
to the
hearing, the Head of Judiciary may ask the accuser if there is more information associated with the record. The responsibility
for providing details falls on the accuser in order for the Judiciary to remain the jury rather than the prosecutor. The accuser
may choose to remain anonymous during the proceedings of the hearing. The accuser should provide all relevant information
in the original record, but may request to attend the hearing if he or she would like to provide additional information. When a
Record is submitted, the Head will alert the Judiciary, the accused, and the accuser (when necessary) of the date, time, and
location of the hearing. Meetings should be called as regularly as possible. Six members of the Judiciary other than the Head
must be present to constitute a quorum.
The accused must appear before the Judiciary on the specified day. If the accused does not do so and does not provide a
viable excuse, they will automatically be given a set punishment. On the day of the hearing, the Head will read the Record
aloud and explain the case to the Judiciary. The Judiciary will then summon and question the accused concerning all aspects
of the case and any connected incidents. Upon completion, the accused will leave the room. Only the eleven members of the
Judiciary and the Faculty Liaison are allowed to be present during deliberation. The panel must first determine if the accused is
innocent or guilty. The accused is considered innocent until proven guilty. If the accused is deemed guilty, the precedent
system—a written record of past rule infractions and their correlating punishments—will be used as a guide during the
deliberation of punishment. However, due to the uniqueness of each case, the precedent system should not necessarily be
followed. Finally, the Judiciary will set a punishment by majority vote. If at any point during the process the Judiciary
determines it has inadequate information, the panel reserves the right to postpone a case until more information has been
gathered from relevant parties. The accused may also be summoned for additional questioning for clarification.
On the following school day, the accused must report to the Dean of Student Life to receive their punishment. If work
hours were assigned, the accused must then contact the appropriate adult to establish a schedule for the completion of the
work hours. If the work hours are not completed within the set time period, the accused will be charged with “work hour
delinquency,” and the uncompleted number of hours shall be doubled automatically. If the accused vehemently maintains their
innocence yet is given work hours, they have the right to formally submit an appeal by email to the Judiciary. After the Dean
of Student Life and the Director are notified of the petition, the Judiciary will hold another hearing to reexamine evidence and
question relevant parties.
Strict confidentiality must be maintained throughout the entire Judiciary process.
V. Judiciary Rules
1. All Judiciary members and the Faculty Liaison must act with seriousness of purpose, maintain respectful conduct, and
lead by example. This is of the utmost importance to the effectiveness of the Judiciary, which must maintain the
respect of the community to function properly.
2. All Judiciary members have equal say and power regardless of age or experience.
3. Those hearing the case and receiving summary memos must maintain the confidentiality of all proceedings and
outcomes. There will be no discussion of the decision-making process in front of the accused. Only the accused has
the right to discuss the Judiciary’s decision; it is that person’s decision alone to discuss their case.
4. If a Judiciary member is responsible for issuing a record, that member will not vote on that case or be present for its
deliberation.
5. If a Judiciary member receives a Record, that member may not be present during the deliberation of the case.
6. Personal bias of any kind against anyone may not affect the vote or discussion of a case. If a panel member feels
unable to ignore a bias, they should recuse themselves from the case.
7. If the accused is found guilty of breaking a rule, even if members of the Judiciary disagree with the rule, the Judiciary
must punish it accordingly.
8. The Judiciary is responsible for punishing any rule infractions that are uncovered during a hearing.
9. The Judiciary must meet at least once per term for a self-evaluation and discussion of any necessary changes to these
rules and the procedures herein.
10. The Judiciary may not assign cruel or unusual punishments.
11. Judiciary members are expected to attend every meeting. A member is allowed one unexcused absence before
being removed from the panel. A member is allowed four excused absences. At the fourth absence, if the absences
are deemed disruptive to the panel’s functioning, the Head of Judiciary will conduct a vote regarding the removal of
the member. In the case of any vacancy, a special election must be held as outlined in Article VII.
12. All Judiciary members must abide by these rules and procedures or be removed from the Judiciary.
Article VI – Measures Governing Behavior
The price of freedom is responsibility embodied by self-restraint and obligation. Regulations are put forth by the
Administration, the Faculty, and the Students to maintain the community’s values and the balance of freedom and
responsibility. The specific regulations can be found in the Reed-N-Heed.
I. Administrative Policies
Administrative policies are limited to issues deemed particularly significant by the Director. They are related to the
advancement of the school’s mission and the protection of the school’s good name. The development of these policies is
the responsibility of the Director alone.
II. Faculty Policies
Faculty policies are the rules and policies deemed to be significant by the Faculty. In general, they are concerned with
the school’s operation and the safety and well being of the student body. While the Faculty has the final say in the
development of Faculty Policy, students have the right to propose any revisions they see fit. Any Faculty member may
propose an amendment to the Faculty Policy. The proposed alteration is taken to the Faculty to be voted on. The
Administration may veto a proposed policy.
Note to Sections I and II:
The Administration and Faculty pledge to hear student opinion relating to the formulation of policies
that concern students, but they reserve the right to make decisions independent of the majority
opinion of students. While the Administration and Faculty are obligated to explain to the students the
reasoning behind actions taken, students’ opinions do not affect a policy’s introduction into the
Read-N-Heed.
III. Student Standards
In keeping with a commitment to the widest possible student participation in government, the Faculty shall designate
realms of the school-community in which students shall be free to govern as described in the Read-N-Heed. Such areas are
intended to develop in students a sense of duty in the exercise of freedom. The designation of Student Standards assumes
close cooperation between Faculty and Students. Students should only petition the Faculty for such designation after sufficient
prior cooperative thinking and planning by representatives of the Faculty and Council. Both Faculty and Students are
responsible for creating a favorable and supportive atmosphere when Students petition to claim a standard. The Faculty shall
refrain from transferring a Faculty Policy to Students unless there is evidence of widespread desire on the part of Students to
undertake responsible management of that area. There should be ongoing discussion between Faculty and Students regarding
the management of an assumed Standard. Faculty may not mandate changes in Standards or in Student enforcement
procedures of the Standards. It is the Faculty’s duty to re-assume control of a Student Standard if students fail to show
responsibility in their governance of that area. In withdrawing a designation of a Student Standard, the Faculty will give its
reasons first to the Council, and then to the Town Meeting, but there is no implication of a right to veto by either group.
The preferred means of enforcement of all Student Standards is persuasion, which if ineffective, may be followed by
a Record as outlined in Article V.
Student Standards are formulated by the following procedure:
Students should initiate an inquiry into the possibility of assuming responsibility for an area, or Faculty may encourage
students to assume responsibility for an area. Any student, in consultation with any member of the school-community they
choose, writes a proposal for standards or revisions to be implemented in the area in question. Faculty may also propose
changes to existing standards. There will be small group discussions of the proposed standards and means of enforcement.
The final proposal is then submitted to and reviewed by the Council. The Council will then hold a vote. If the proposed
revision passes the Council, the revisions will then be voted on in a Faculty meeting. Representatives from the Council should
attend the Faculty meeting in order to maintain thorough communication. If it passes the Faculty, the proposed Standards
must be presented in a Town Meeting and voted on for final approval. For the amendment to pass the Council, Faculty, and
Town Meeting, the revisions must have a two-thirds majority support of each. If the consultation procedure does not produce
widespread commitment to the proposal on the part of students, the Mayor will remand the matter to the originating group for
further consideration.
At the beginning of the school year, the Council should review existing standards and present them to the Town
Meeting (or to small groups) for consideration and possible revision. Standards of the preceding year are in effect until this
is done.
Article VII – Elections
In order for a democracy to survive, it must be self-perpetuating through the orderly and fair transition of power by
means of open elections.
1. Elections for the Council and the Judiciary will be held biannually near the end of each semester.
2. Only students are allowed to vote in elections. Every student, regardless of circumstance, is allowed and encouraged
to vote.
3. The Faculty has no input in who is allowed to run. Any student may run for a position regardless of circumstance.
4. In order to run for a public office, students must petition. The Council will specify and publicize the nature of the
petition for each office. Petitions for Mayor and Commissions must include platforms and signatures as defined
in Article IV and the Council is responsible for making all platforms public.
5. While students may run for only one office in the Council, they are permitted to run for the Judiciary in addition to an
office in the Council.
6. Each candidate is entrusted with using their best judgment in carrying out a campaign, should they choose to have
one. All campaign material must be appropriate and aimed at positively portraying a candidate rather than negatively
portraying a competitor. The Council may vote to disqualify a candidate who has deviated from these requirements.
7. A special Town Meeting will be held prior to each election day in which candidates may make speeches presenting their
platforms. The Council will administer this Town Meeting and make public the agenda thereof before the meeting.
8. Voting will be by secret ballot after the special Town Meeting. The Council must determine the optimal method to
conduct a fair and impartial voting process, which should be made public before voting commences. The Council
may appoint other students and Faculty members to assist them.
9. The Council will tally the votes and may appoint other students and Faculty members to assist them. The numerical
statistics are to be kept completely confidential, with only the results of the election posted and not the number of
votes each candidate received.
10. Election is by an Alternative Vote. Voters will be given the option to rank the candidates in order of First Choice,
Second Choice, etc. If the candidate with the highest number of First Choice votes obtains a majority, they win the
election. If said candidate does not receive a majority of all votes cast, the candidate with the lowest number of
First Option votes will drop out and their votes will transfer to each respective voter’s Second Choice. This process
will repeat automatically until there is a clear majority winner.
11. If less than three-quarters of the student body participates in the election, there will be a re-election. Elections for
the Commission of Boarding will require three-quarters participation from the boarding student community.
12. No candidate for an election may assist in the election process. Therefore, Council members who plan to run in the
election may neither participate in decisions that the Council makes concerning the election nor assist in
administering the voting or counting.
13. The Council must choose the members who are primarily responsible for conducting the election process. Usually,
this duty is allotted to either the Commission of Citizenship or the Commission of Protection. However, if students
holding both Commissions plan to run for office, the Council must elect two impartial council members to run the
election.
14. In the case of a vacancy in the offices of the Mayor or the Commissions, the Town Meeting must decide by a two
thirds majority vote whether or not the vacancy should be filled. In the case of a vacancy in the offices of the
Class Representatives, the relevant Class Meeting will decide by a two-thirds majority vote whether or not the
vacancy should be filled. If it is decided that a vacancy should be filled, the normal election procedure will take
place. If a vacancy should arise in the Judiciary, the vacancy must be filled by a special election.
Article VIII – Impeachment of Elected Officials
Any member of the Indian Springs school-community can suggest the impeachment of an elected student official.
There are separate processes for the impeachment and removal of students from various offices.
I. Students holding the offices of the Council may be accused and impeached by the following process:
1. The accuser must present the proposal of impeachment to the Judiciary, either in person or in writing, giving specific
reasons for impeachment. The accuser has the option to remain anonymous.
2. The Judiciary will install the Student Recorder as the Impeachment Recorder to record the arguments and proceedings
of the impeachment trial. If the Student Recorder is unable to be impartial, another member of the Judiciary may be
elected by majority vote to be the Impeachment Recorder.
3. The Judiciary can decide on the manner in which to conduct the trial but must hear both the accuser’s and the
accused’s arguments. Based on the trial, the Judiciary will decide by majority vote whether or not the
proposed impeachment should continue to the Town Meeting or the Class Meeting.
4. If the Judiciary decides to advance the impeachment case of a Class Representative, then the case will go to the
respective Class Meeting. Cases for all other Council offices will advance to the Town Meeting. The proceedings in
the preliminary stages (outlined in a, b, and c) are to remain completely confidential even after the Town Meeting
or the Class Meeting, if one is held. Only the information and arguments that the Judiciary deems important
enough for the Impeachment Recorder to present in public meetings may be disclosed, in the case of a Town
Meeting or Class Meeting. Only the Impeachment Recorder may present such information.
5. The Impeachment Recorder must make a presentation to the Town Meeting if the accused is a Mayor or
Commissioner, or to the Class Meeting if the accused is a Class Representative. This presentation should include the
accusations against the official and the accused official’s defense in an equal and unbiased manner. Students in the
Town Meeting or Class Meeting will then vote by secret ballot on whether or not to remove the impeached official
from office. If the impeachment passes the Town Meeting or Class Meeting by a two-thirds majority, the official will
be removed from office immediately.
6. The vacancy procedure outlined in Article VII will determine whether or not a special election will be held.
II. Students holding chairs on the Judiciary may be accused and impeached by the following process:
1. The accuser must present the proposal of impeachment to the Council, either in person or in writing, giving specific
reasons for impeachment. The accuser has the option to remain anonymous.
2. The Council must elect by majority vote an impartial member of the Council to be the Impeachment Recorder to record
the arguments and proceedings of the impeachment trial.
3. The Council can decide on the manner in which to conduct the trial but must hear both the accuser’s and the accused’s
arguments. Based on the trial, the Council will decide by a two-thirds majority vote whether or not the proposed
impeachment should continue to the Town Meeting.
4. The proceedings in the preliminary stages (outlined in a, b, and c) are to remain completely confidential even after the
Town Meeting, if one is held. Only the information and arguments that the Council deems important enough for the
Impeachment Recorder to present in a public meeting may be disclosed, in the case of a Town Meeting. Only the
Impeachment Recorder may present such information.
5. The Impeachment Recorder must present the accusations against the official and the defenses of the accused to the
Town Meeting in an equal and unbiased manner. Students will then vote by secret ballot on whether or not to
remove the impeached official from office. If the impeachment passes the Town Meeting by a two-thirds majority,
the official will be removed from office immediately.
6. In the case that a Judiciary member is impeached, there must be a special election to fill the vacancy.
Article IX – Amendments
Provided that every member of the school-community has the power and obligation to improve it through constructive
change, any person may submit a proposal to amend the Constitution at any time during the academic year. The proposed
amendment must first be submitted to and reviewed by the Council. The Council will hold a vote. If the proposed
amendment passes the Council, the revisions will then go to a Faculty meeting to be voted on. Representatives from the
Council should attend the Faculty meeting in order to maintain thorough communication. If it passes the Faculty, the
revisions must be presented in a Town Meeting and voted on for final approval. For the amendment to pass the Council,
Faculty, and Town
Meeting, the revisions must have two-thirds majority support of each. If at any point significant revisions are made to
an amendment, the process will begin again with the Council’s review.
The Indian Springs School Constitution
Preamble
Under the freedom granted the faculty and students of Indian Springs School by the Board of Governors of the
Alabama Educational Foundation, the governing body of Indian Springs School, there is herewith created the official Indian
Springs School Constitution.
The purpose of the Indian Springs School Constitution and Government is to promote living and learning in accordance
with humane and democratic values and principles, thereby contributing to the intellectual, physical, emotional, spiritual, and
ethical development of all members of the Indian Springs school-community.
In establishing this Constitution, the members of the Indian Springs school-community affirm that students and teachers
do not have to accept themselves or their surroundings as they are but that it is within their power to improve both through
participation in constructive change. Such participation enhances the worth and dignity of humankind, develops responsibility,
and leads persons to the realization of latent powers.
Article I – School-Community Life
The school-community exists for the purpose of providing an environment in which each individual can develop to his
or her full stature.
I. Rights
Each individual has certain rights that are equal for each person. Individuals are guaranteed maximum freedom so long
as they do not infringe upon the rights of others or threaten the general welfare of the school-community.
This Constitution guarantees:
1. The right to freedom of religion, speech, inquiry, and criticism.
2. The right of students to select representatives in the government.
3. The right of students to run for public office.
4. The right to petition the Council or Faculty.
5. The right to assemble peacefully.
6. The right to be considered innocent until proven guilty.
II. Values and Ideals
Certain values and ideals are prized because they contribute to making the school-community a better place in which to
live and learn. Each individual is responsible for working toward the realization of these values and ideals.
In our school-community, we aspire to:
1. Show respect towards the opinions and beliefs of others.
2. Develop genuine friendships.
3. Respect the worth and dignity of the individual.
4. Widen the area of common agreement by which decisions are made and actions taken.
5. Develop personal integrity and moral courage.
6. Help individuals to develop their talents and skills.
7. Stimulate individuals to give direct, unselfish service to the school-community.
8. Reflect disapproval of behavior wherein one individual does or says things harmful to another or to the good name of
the school.
9. Prohibit any organized group that divides or tends to divide the school-community.
We encourage individuals to:
1. Accept their political responsibilities.
2. Keep informed about school-community jobs because the general welfare requires it.

4. Use democratic methods to achieve group agreement.
5. Consider the common good before group or personal liberties.
6. Live in accordance with agreed-upon standards.
7. Evaluate the school-community continuously in an effort to improve it.
Article II – Structure of the Government
The divisions of government are:
1. The Director of Indian Springs School, who is appointed by the Board of Governors.
2. The Administration.
3. The Faculty.
4. The Student Government:
a. Town Meeting: a legislative body comprised of all students that, second to the Administration and Faculty, is the
authority of government at Indian Springs.
b. Council: an executive body comprised of the Mayor, the Commissions, and the Class Representatives. c.
Judiciary: a judicial body comprised of students who hear and rule on infractions of policies, rules, and standards.
Article III – Town Meeting
The heart of the Government at Indian Springs School is the Town Meeting. Town Meeting is open to all citizens and
has three main functions:
1. The Town Meeting serves as the legislative branch of Government and is the final authority on all issues in which the
Faculty is neutral. While the Town Meeting is open to all citizens, only students are allowed to vote. Three-quarters
of the student body constitutes a quorum. Decisions will be made by at least a two-thirds majority vote. The
presiding officer will determine whether the voting will be secret or public.
2. The Town Meeting serves as an open forum in which students can freely voice their concerns and opinions about
pressing issues in an effort to improve the overall quality of life in the school-community.
3. The Town Meeting is a means of communication among all citizens of the school-community. Because a democracy
cannot survive unless its citizens remain consistently informed, weekly meetings are encouraged; however, the
frequency of meetings is determined by need.
Town Meetings are called either by the Mayor with the consent of the Faculty or by the Faculty. Students have the right to
request to have a Town Meeting either through the Council, Faculty, or Director. The Mayor has the right to call a
students-only Town Meeting.
The presiding officer of the Town Meeting is the Mayor. In the absence of the Mayor, the Council will designate a presiding
officer. However, if the Town Meeting is called by the Faculty, the Director or someone designated by the Faculty may take
charge of the meeting.
Article IV – The Council
The Council is a body of students elected entirely by the students for the purpose of providing leadership in the
community. The most important responsibility of the Council is to assess the quality of school-community life and improve it
on as many levels as possible.
I. The offices of the Council are:
1. The Mayor, whose duty is to provide leadership for the Council and the community as a whole in building a greater
understanding of the aims and purposes of the community and to bring about the realization of these aims and
purposes through the various Council offices. The Mayor is responsible for seeing that each Council office fulfills
its respective duties and platforms and for coordinating the work of the Council.
2. Commission of Citizenship, whose duties are concerned with the continuing evaluation of the quality of citizenship as
exhibited on a day-to-day basis, in and out of the classroom, and in the larger community beyond the boundaries
of Indian Springs School. Specific examples can include, but are not limited to, organizing Development Day,
promoting service opportunities, and overseeing student clubs.
3. Commission of Education, whose duties are concerned with the continuing evaluation and improvement of teaching
and learning and of the conditions that influence the academic experience. Specific examples can include, but are
not limited to, managing the Writing Center, creating a student tutor system, and participating in Academics
Committee meetings.
4. Commission of Protection, whose duties are concerned with the enforcement of the standards of the school-community
and the promotion of environmental protection. Specific examples can include, but are not limited to, reporting
attendance at mandatory meetings and issuing Records for unexcused absences at such meetings, organizing and
carrying out campus recycling, and discouraging littering, and managing matters surrounding the American flag(s)
flown on campus. Members of the commission are, in a special sense, guardians of the rights, values, principles, and
ideals set out in this Constitution. The preferred method of enforcement of such standards is persuasion. However,
where persuasion does not prove successful, the commission may take more stringent measures.
5. Commission of Recreation, whose duties are concerned with the continuing evaluation and improvement of wholesome
recreational activities in the school-community. Specific examples can include, but are not limited to, organizing
school dances, planning Winter Formal, and leading activities that promote school spirit.
6. Commission of Services, whose duties are concerned with the continuing evaluation and improvement of the range of
needed services in the school-community. The most evident example of this duty is the operation of the student
store.
7. Commission of Boarding, whose duties are concerned with the continuing evaluation and improvement of dormitory
life, which involves the facilitation and execution of dormitory administration such as maintenance and rule
enforcement. The Commission is to be elected from and by the boarding student community as outlined in Article VII.
8. Deputies, who are students installed by a specific Commission to aid in the execution of its duties and to expand
community participation in Government. Each Commission may have up to three Deputies, with the exception of
Commissioners of Boarding, who may have up to two deputies in each dormitory. No one in any of the Council
offices may become a Deputy, and Deputies may serve only one Commission. Deputies are nominated by the
Commission and must be approved individually by the Council. The Commission or the Council may remove a Deputy
at any time; when a Commission leaves office, the Deputies of that Commission also leave their posts. Deputies do
not have a vote in the Council but are strongly encouraged to attend Council meetings.
9. Class Representatives, whose duties are concerned with the continuing evaluation of opinions and desires of their
respective classes. Class Representatives are responsible for organizing and voicing class concerns to the Council
and for taking attendance for their respective grades at mandatory meetings. Each class will elect one or two
representatives from its own class and for its own class.
10. The Council Secretary, whose duties are concerned with the documentation and communication of recent plans,
updates, and discussions mentioned during Student Government and Town Meetings and contributing to task
management within the Council. Specific examples can include, but are not limited to, taking notes during Council
meetings, taking notes during Town Meetings, and assisting the Mayor in certain projects. These notes must be
reviewed and approved by the Council before their release. The Council Secretary does not have a vote in the
Council. The Council Secretary is nominated by the Mayor and must be approved individually by the Council through a
⅔majority vote.
II. Additional responsibilities of the Council:
1. Each office of the Council must prepare a written platform, a program of action to be implemented during the specified
term of office. This platform should present the goals and methodology for the office.
2. The Council should hold regular meetings to discuss and evaluate ongoing programs. The meetings are compulsory for
all members unless a viable excuse is given. Embracing the principles of democracy, all members of the school
community are encouraged to attend Council meetings.
3. The Council must, at times, make decisions on items such as those called for in this Constitution. In order to make
these decisions, the Council must vote. Three-quarters of the Council constitutes a quorum, and decisions will be
made by a two-thirds majority vote.
4. The Council must administer elections at the end of each semester, as outlined in Article VII.
5. The Mayor has final responsibility for the effectiveness of the Council, and the Director of Indian Springs School has
final responsibility for the effectiveness of the Faculty Liaisons, which are mentor Faculty members assigned to
each Commission and Class. It is the duty of the Mayor and Director to see that the Commissions and Liaisons
develop a unified program in order to improve specific aspects of the school-community from the vantage point of
a comprehensive view of school-community problems.
Article V – The Judiciary
The Indian Springs School Judiciary is a panel elected entirely by the students for the purpose of hearing and ruling on
infractions of policies, rules, and standards within the school-community. The Judiciary is composed of eleven students and
one Faculty Liaison. The eleven-member panel must be composed of one 8th (for the second semester only), one 9th, one
10th, one 11th, and one 12th grader as well as two boarding students, elected by popular vote by the entire student body.
Once these stipulations have been met, the remaining spots will be filled by those receiving the highest number of votes. Any
student who wishes to run for the Judiciary is both welcome and encouraged to do so. The Faculty has no input regarding
who is allowed to run.
I. Offices of Judiciary
There are two offices of Judiciary: the Head of Judiciary and the Student Recorder. Both positions are elected at the first
Judiciary meeting following general elections by a combined panel of incoming and outgoing members of the Judiciary. Voting
is anonymous, and offices are decided by majority vote.
1. The Head of Judiciary is the leader of the panel and serves as a guide and moderator during discussions rather than a
member advocating their own opinions. The Head of Judiciary has no vote during regular meetings except in the case of a tie,
where they serve as a tiebreaker. In order to run for Head of Judiciary, a student must have previously served at least one
term on the panel, if there is such a person. The Head of Judiciary is responsible for organizing meeting times, bringing a
copy of the Read ‘n’ Heed, Records, and precedents to every meeting, taking attendance at meetings, and notifying the
accused of the accused offense as well as the date, time, and location of the hearing. After each hearing, it is the Head’s
responsibility to provide the Dean of Student Life with a report of all cases, rulings, and work hours or other punishments
given.
2. The Student Recorder keeps an accurate record of the decisions made by the Judiciary and serves as the
Impeachment Recorder during the impeachment of a Council member as outlined in Article VIII. In the event of the Head of
Judiciary receiving a Record, the Student Recorder assumes the role of Head of Judiciary for that case.
II. The Faculty Liaison
The Faculty Liaison to the Judiciary is the Faculty’s representation on the panel. They serve only as a guide; students
maintain the primary responsibility and control of the Judiciary. The Faculty Liaison may voice an opinion, act as a clarifier
and interpreter of the rules, and assist in interrogating the accused. They may not vote during regular meetings or during
the election of offices. The Faculty Liaison is responsible for creating a written memo of all proceedings of the Judiciary to
distribute to the Director, the Dean of Academics, the Dean of Student Life, and the Dean of Residential Life. The Faculty
Liaison is expected to abide by all policies, rules, and procedures of the Judiciary.
III. The Dean of Student Life
The Dean of Student Life is not a member of the Judiciary and is not present during meetings; they serve as an outside
assistant in executing the administrative duties of the Judiciary. After each meeting, an outline of all decisions, including a
breakdown of the work hours and/or other punishments and their corresponding offenses, is given to the Dean of Student
Life by the Head of Judiciary. The Dean of Student Life is responsible for notifying each student and their Faculty Advisor of
the work hour assignment and/or other punishment given by the Judiciary. It is the Dean of Student Life’s responsibility to
keep track of work hours performed and time frames for other punishments for each student. When a Faculty member
submits a record, they are to be informed of the case’s outcome by the Dean of Student Life.
IV. Judiciary Procedure
Persuasion is the primary means of enforcement of the rules in the school-community. However, acknowledging that a
warning may not alter behavior in all situations, a Record may be issued after persuasion has been attempted. Any member of
the community may write a Record to report a rule infraction. Records are submitted to the Head of Judiciary through email.
In the Record, the accuser should provide a detailed written explanation of the situation along with any other relevant
information. If there is not enough information from the accuser to prove guilt, the accused should be deemed innocent. Prior
to the
hearing, the Head of Judiciary may ask the accuser if there is more information associated with the record. The responsibility
for providing details falls on the accuser in order for the Judiciary to remain the jury rather than the prosecutor. The accuser
may choose to remain anonymous during the proceedings of the hearing. The accuser should provide all relevant information
in the original record, but may request to attend the hearing if he or she would like to provide additional information. When a
Record is submitted, the Head will alert the Judiciary, the accused, and the accuser (when necessary) of the date, time, and
location of the hearing. Meetings should be called as regularly as possible. Six members of the Judiciary other than the Head
must be present to constitute a quorum.
The accused must appear before the Judiciary on the specified day. If the accused does not do so and does not provide a
viable excuse, they will automatically be given a set punishment. On the day of the hearing, the Head will read the Record
aloud and explain the case to the Judiciary. The Judiciary will then summon and question the accused concerning all aspects
of the case and any connected incidents. Upon completion, the accused will leave the room. Only the eleven members of the
Judiciary and the Faculty Liaison are allowed to be present during deliberation. The panel must first determine if the accused is
innocent or guilty. The accused is considered innocent until proven guilty. If the accused is deemed guilty, the precedent
system—a written record of past rule infractions and their correlating punishments—will be used as a guide during the
deliberation of punishment. However, due to the uniqueness of each case, the precedent system should not necessarily be
followed. Finally, the Judiciary will set a punishment by majority vote. If at any point during the process the Judiciary
determines it has inadequate information, the panel reserves the right to postpone a case until more information has been
gathered from relevant parties. The accused may also be summoned for additional questioning for clarification.
On the following school day, the accused must report to the Dean of Student Life to receive their punishment. If work
hours were assigned, the accused must then contact the appropriate adult to establish a schedule for the completion of the
work hours. If the work hours are not completed within the set time period, the accused will be charged with “work hour
delinquency,” and the uncompleted number of hours shall be doubled automatically. If the accused vehemently maintains their
innocence yet is given work hours, they have the right to formally submit an appeal by email to the Judiciary. After the Dean
of Student Life and the Director are notified of the petition, the Judiciary will hold another hearing to reexamine evidence and
question relevant parties.
Strict confidentiality must be maintained throughout the entire Judiciary process.
V. Judiciary Rules
1. All Judiciary members and the Faculty Liaison must act with seriousness of purpose, maintain respectful conduct, and
lead by example. This is of the utmost importance to the effectiveness of the Judiciary, which must maintain the
respect of the community to function properly.
2. All Judiciary members have equal say and power regardless of age or experience.
3. Those hearing the case and receiving summary memos must maintain the confidentiality of all proceedings and
outcomes. There will be no discussion of the decision-making process in front of the accused. Only the accused has
the right to discuss the Judiciary’s decision; it is that person’s decision alone to discuss their case.
4. If a Judiciary member is responsible for issuing a record, that member will not vote on that case or be present for its
deliberation.
5. If a Judiciary member receives a Record, that member may not be present during the deliberation of the case.
6. Personal bias of any kind against anyone may not affect the vote or discussion of a case. If a panel member feels
unable to ignore a bias, they should recuse themselves from the case.
7. If the accused is found guilty of breaking a rule, even if members of the Judiciary disagree with the rule, the Judiciary
must punish it accordingly.
8. The Judiciary is responsible for punishing any rule infractions that are uncovered during a hearing.
9. The Judiciary must meet at least once per term for a self-evaluation and discussion of any necessary changes to these
rules and the procedures herein.
10. The Judiciary may not assign cruel or unusual punishments.
11. Judiciary members are expected to attend every meeting. A member is allowed one unexcused absence before
being removed from the panel. A member is allowed four excused absences. At the fourth absence, if the absences
are deemed disruptive to the panel’s functioning, the Head of Judiciary will conduct a vote regarding the removal of
the member. In the case of any vacancy, a special election must be held as outlined in Article VII.
12. All Judiciary members must abide by these rules and procedures or be removed from the Judiciary.
Article VI – Measures Governing Behavior
The price of freedom is responsibility embodied by self-restraint and obligation. Regulations are put forth by the
Administration, the Faculty, and the Students to maintain the community’s values and the balance of freedom and
responsibility. The specific regulations can be found in the Reed-N-Heed.
I. Administrative Policies
Administrative policies are limited to issues deemed particularly significant by the Director. They are related to the
advancement of the school’s mission and the protection of the school’s good name. The development of these policies is
the responsibility of the Director alone.
II. Faculty Policies
Faculty policies are the rules and policies deemed to be significant by the Faculty. In general, they are concerned with
the school’s operation and the safety and well being of the student body. While the Faculty has the final say in the
development of Faculty Policy, students have the right to propose any revisions they see fit. Any Faculty member may
propose an amendment to the Faculty Policy. The proposed alteration is taken to the Faculty to be voted on. The
Administration may veto a proposed policy.
Note to Sections I and II:
The Administration and Faculty pledge to hear student opinion relating to the formulation of policies
that concern students, but they reserve the right to make decisions independent of the majority
opinion of students. While the Administration and Faculty are obligated to explain to the students the
reasoning behind actions taken, students’ opinions do not affect a policy’s introduction into the
Read-N-Heed.
III. Student Standards
In keeping with a commitment to the widest possible student participation in government, the Faculty shall designate
realms of the school-community in which students shall be free to govern as described in the Read-N-Heed. Such areas are
intended to develop in students a sense of duty in the exercise of freedom. The designation of Student Standards assumes
close cooperation between Faculty and Students. Students should only petition the Faculty for such designation after sufficient
prior cooperative thinking and planning by representatives of the Faculty and Council. Both Faculty and Students are
responsible for creating a favorable and supportive atmosphere when Students petition to claim a standard. The Faculty shall
refrain from transferring a Faculty Policy to Students unless there is evidence of widespread desire on the part of Students to
undertake responsible management of that area. There should be ongoing discussion between Faculty and Students regarding
the management of an assumed Standard. Faculty may not mandate changes in Standards or in Student enforcement
procedures of the Standards. It is the Faculty’s duty to re-assume control of a Student Standard if students fail to show
responsibility in their governance of that area. In withdrawing a designation of a Student Standard, the Faculty will give its
reasons first to the Council, and then to the Town Meeting, but there is no implication of a right to veto by either group.
The preferred means of enforcement of all Student Standards is persuasion, which if ineffective, may be followed by
a Record as outlined in Article V.
Student Standards are formulated by the following procedure:
Students should initiate an inquiry into the possibility of assuming responsibility for an area, or Faculty may encourage
students to assume responsibility for an area. Any student, in consultation with any member of the school-community they
choose, writes a proposal for standards or revisions to be implemented in the area in question. Faculty may also propose
changes to existing standards. There will be small group discussions of the proposed standards and means of enforcement.
The final proposal is then submitted to and reviewed by the Council. The Council will then hold a vote. If the proposed
revision passes the Council, the revisions will then be voted on in a Faculty meeting. Representatives from the Council should
attend the Faculty meeting in order to maintain thorough communication. If it passes the Faculty, the proposed Standards
must be presented in a Town Meeting and voted on for final approval. For the amendment to pass the Council, Faculty, and
Town Meeting, the revisions must have a two-thirds majority support of each. If the consultation procedure does not produce
widespread commitment to the proposal on the part of students, the Mayor will remand the matter to the originating group for
further consideration.
At the beginning of the school year, the Council should review existing standards and present them to the Town
Meeting (or to small groups) for consideration and possible revision. Standards of the preceding year are in effect until this
is done.
Article VII – Elections
In order for a democracy to survive, it must be self-perpetuating through the orderly and fair transition of power by
means of open elections.
1. Elections for the Council and the Judiciary will be held biannually near the end of each semester.
2. Only students are allowed to vote in elections. Every student, regardless of circumstance, is allowed and encouraged
to vote.
3. The Faculty has no input in who is allowed to run. Any student may run for a position regardless of circumstance.
4. In order to run for a public office, students must petition. The Council will specify and publicize the nature of the
petition for each office. Petitions for Mayor and Commissions must include platforms and signatures as defined
in Article IV and the Council is responsible for making all platforms public.
5. While students may run for only one office in the Council, they are permitted to run for the Judiciary in addition to an
office in the Council.
6. Each candidate is entrusted with using their best judgment in carrying out a campaign, should they choose to have
one. All campaign material must be appropriate and aimed at positively portraying a candidate rather than negatively
portraying a competitor. The Council may vote to disqualify a candidate who has deviated from these requirements.
7. A special Town Meeting will be held prior to each election day in which candidates may make speeches presenting their
platforms. The Council will administer this Town Meeting and make public the agenda thereof before the meeting.
8. Voting will be by secret ballot after the special Town Meeting. The Council must determine the optimal method to
conduct a fair and impartial voting process, which should be made public before voting commences. The Council
may appoint other students and Faculty members to assist them.
9. The Council will tally the votes and may appoint other students and Faculty members to assist them. The numerical
statistics are to be kept completely confidential, with only the results of the election posted and not the number of
votes each candidate received.
10. Election is by an Alternative Vote. Voters will be given the option to rank the candidates in order of First Choice,
Second Choice, etc. If the candidate with the highest number of First Choice votes obtains a majority, they win the
election. If said candidate does not receive a majority of all votes cast, the candidate with the lowest number of
First Option votes will drop out and their votes will transfer to each respective voter’s Second Choice. This process
will repeat automatically until there is a clear majority winner.
11. If less than three-quarters of the student body participates in the election, there will be a re-election. Elections for
the Commission of Boarding will require three-quarters participation from the boarding student community.
12. No candidate for an election may assist in the election process. Therefore, Council members who plan to run in the
election may neither participate in decisions that the Council makes concerning the election nor assist in
administering the voting or counting.
13. The Council must choose the members who are primarily responsible for conducting the election process. Usually,
this duty is allotted to either the Commission of Citizenship or the Commission of Protection. However, if students
holding both Commissions plan to run for office, the Council must elect two impartial council members to run the
election.
14. In the case of a vacancy in the offices of the Mayor or the Commissions, the Town Meeting must decide by a two
thirds majority vote whether or not the vacancy should be filled. In the case of a vacancy in the offices of the
Class Representatives, the relevant Class Meeting will decide by a two-thirds majority vote whether or not the
vacancy should be filled. If it is decided that a vacancy should be filled, the normal election procedure will take
place. If a vacancy should arise in the Judiciary, the vacancy must be filled by a special election.
Article VIII – Impeachment of Elected Officials
Any member of the Indian Springs school-community can suggest the impeachment of an elected student official.
There are separate processes for the impeachment and removal of students from various offices.
I. Students holding the offices of the Council may be accused and impeached by the following process:
1. The accuser must present the proposal of impeachment to the Judiciary, either in person or in writing, giving specific
reasons for impeachment. The accuser has the option to remain anonymous.
2. The Judiciary will install the Student Recorder as the Impeachment Recorder to record the arguments and proceedings
of the impeachment trial. If the Student Recorder is unable to be impartial, another member of the Judiciary may be
elected by majority vote to be the Impeachment Recorder.
3. The Judiciary can decide on the manner in which to conduct the trial but must hear both the accuser’s and the
accused’s arguments. Based on the trial, the Judiciary will decide by majority vote whether or not the
proposed impeachment should continue to the Town Meeting or the Class Meeting.
4. If the Judiciary decides to advance the impeachment case of a Class Representative, then the case will go to the
respective Class Meeting. Cases for all other Council offices will advance to the Town Meeting. The proceedings in
the preliminary stages (outlined in a, b, and c) are to remain completely confidential even after the Town Meeting
or the Class Meeting, if one is held. Only the information and arguments that the Judiciary deems important
enough for the Impeachment Recorder to present in public meetings may be disclosed, in the case of a Town
Meeting or Class Meeting. Only the Impeachment Recorder may present such information.
5. The Impeachment Recorder must make a presentation to the Town Meeting if the accused is a Mayor or
Commissioner, or to the Class Meeting if the accused is a Class Representative. This presentation should include the
accusations against the official and the accused official’s defense in an equal and unbiased manner. Students in the
Town Meeting or Class Meeting will then vote by secret ballot on whether or not to remove the impeached official
from office. If the impeachment passes the Town Meeting or Class Meeting by a two-thirds majority, the official will
be removed from office immediately.
6. The vacancy procedure outlined in Article VII will determine whether or not a special election will be held.
II. Students holding chairs on the Judiciary may be accused and impeached by the following process:
1. The accuser must present the proposal of impeachment to the Council, either in person or in writing, giving specific
reasons for impeachment. The accuser has the option to remain anonymous.
2. The Council must elect by majority vote an impartial member of the Council to be the Impeachment Recorder to record
the arguments and proceedings of the impeachment trial.
3. The Council can decide on the manner in which to conduct the trial but must hear both the accuser’s and the accused’s
arguments. Based on the trial, the Council will decide by a two-thirds majority vote whether or not the proposed
impeachment should continue to the Town Meeting.
4. The proceedings in the preliminary stages (outlined in a, b, and c) are to remain completely confidential even after the
Town Meeting, if one is held. Only the information and arguments that the Council deems important enough for the
Impeachment Recorder to present in a public meeting may be disclosed, in the case of a Town Meeting. Only the
Impeachment Recorder may present such information.
5. The Impeachment Recorder must present the accusations against the official and the defenses of the accused to the
Town Meeting in an equal and unbiased manner. Students will then vote by secret ballot on whether or not to
remove the impeached official from office. If the impeachment passes the Town Meeting by a two-thirds majority,
the official will be removed from office immediately.
6. In the case that a Judiciary member is impeached, there must be a special election to fill the vacancy.
Article IX – Amendments
Provided that every member of the school-community has the power and obligation to improve it through constructive
change, any person may submit a proposal to amend the Constitution at any time during the academic year. The proposed
amendment must first be submitted to and reviewed by the Council. The Council will hold a vote. If the proposed
amendment passes the Council, the revisions will then go to a Faculty meeting to be voted on. Representatives from the
Council should attend the Faculty meeting in order to maintain thorough communication. If it passes the Faculty, the
revisions must be presented in a Town Meeting and voted on for final approval. For the amendment to pass the Council,
Faculty, and Town
Meeting, the revisions must have two-thirds majority support of each. If at any point significant revisions are made to
an amendment, the process will begin again with the Council’s review.
The Indian Springs School Constitution
Preamble
Under the freedom granted the faculty and students of Indian Springs School by the Board of Governors of the
Alabama Educational Foundation, the governing body of Indian Springs School, there is herewith created the official Indian
Springs School Constitution.
The purpose of the Indian Springs School Constitution and Government is to promote living and learning in accordance
with humane and democratic values and principles, thereby contributing to the intellectual, physical, emotional, spiritual, and
ethical development of all members of the Indian Springs school-community.
In establishing this Constitution, the members of the Indian Springs school-community affirm that students and teachers
do not have to accept themselves or their surroundings as they are but that it is within their power to improve both through
participation in constructive change. Such participation enhances the worth and dignity of humankind, develops responsibility,
and leads persons to the realization of latent powers.
Article I – School-Community Life
The school-community exists for the purpose of providing an environment in which each individual can develop to his
or her full stature.
I. Rights
Each individual has certain rights that are equal for each person. Individuals are guaranteed maximum freedom so long
as they do not infringe upon the rights of others or threaten the general welfare of the school-community.
This Constitution guarantees:
1. The right to freedom of religion, speech, inquiry, and criticism.
2. The right of students to select representatives in the government.
3. The right of students to run for public office.
4. The right to petition the Council or Faculty.
5. The right to assemble peacefully.
6. The right to be considered innocent until proven guilty.
II. Values and Ideals
Certain values and ideals are prized because they contribute to making the school-community a better place in which to
live and learn. Each individual is responsible for working toward the realization of these values and ideals.
In our school-community, we aspire to:
1. Show respect towards the opinions and beliefs of others.
2. Develop genuine friendships.
3. Respect the worth and dignity of the individual.
4. Widen the area of common agreement by which decisions are made and actions taken.
5. Develop personal integrity and moral courage.
6. Help individuals to develop their talents and skills.
7. Stimulate individuals to give direct, unselfish service to the school-community.
8. Reflect disapproval of behavior wherein one individual does or says things harmful to another or to the good name of
the school.
9. Prohibit any organized group that divides or tends to divide the school-community.
We encourage individuals to:
1. Accept their political responsibilities.

4. Use democratic methods to achieve group agreement.
5. Consider the common good before group or personal liberties.
6. Live in accordance with agreed-upon standards.
7. Evaluate the school-community continuously in an effort to improve it.
Article II – Structure of the Government
The divisions of government are:
1. The Director of Indian Springs School, who is appointed by the Board of Governors.
2. The Administration.
3. The Faculty.
4. The Student Government:
a. Town Meeting: a legislative body comprised of all students that, second to the Administration and Faculty, is the
authority of government at Indian Springs.
b. Council: an executive body comprised of the Mayor, the Commissions, and the Class Representatives. c.
Judiciary: a judicial body comprised of students who hear and rule on infractions of policies, rules, and standards.
Article III – Town Meeting
The heart of the Government at Indian Springs School is the Town Meeting. Town Meeting is open to all citizens and
has three main functions:
1. The Town Meeting serves as the legislative branch of Government and is the final authority on all issues in which the
Faculty is neutral. While the Town Meeting is open to all citizens, only students are allowed to vote. Three-quarters
of the student body constitutes a quorum. Decisions will be made by at least a two-thirds majority vote. The
presiding officer will determine whether the voting will be secret or public.
2. The Town Meeting serves as an open forum in which students can freely voice their concerns and opinions about
pressing issues in an effort to improve the overall quality of life in the school-community.
3. The Town Meeting is a means of communication among all citizens of the school-community. Because a democracy
cannot survive unless its citizens remain consistently informed, weekly meetings are encouraged; however, the
frequency of meetings is determined by need.
Town Meetings are called either by the Mayor with the consent of the Faculty or by the Faculty. Students have the right to
request to have a Town Meeting either through the Council, Faculty, or Director. The Mayor has the right to call a
students-only Town Meeting.
The presiding officer of the Town Meeting is the Mayor. In the absence of the Mayor, the Council will designate a presiding
officer. However, if the Town Meeting is called by the Faculty, the Director or someone designated by the Faculty may take
charge of the meeting.
Article IV – The Council
The Council is a body of students elected entirely by the students for the purpose of providing leadership in the
community. The most important responsibility of the Council is to assess the quality of school-community life and improve it
on as many levels as possible.
I. The offices of the Council are:
1. The Mayor, whose duty is to provide leadership for the Council and the community as a whole in building a greater
understanding of the aims and purposes of the community and to bring about the realization of these aims and
purposes through the various Council offices. The Mayor is responsible for seeing that each Council office fulfills
its respective duties and platforms and for coordinating the work of the Council.
2. Commission of Citizenship, whose duties are concerned with the continuing evaluation of the quality of citizenship as
exhibited on a day-to-day basis, in and out of the classroom, and in the larger community beyond the boundaries
of Indian Springs School. Specific examples can include, but are not limited to, organizing Development Day,
promoting service opportunities, and overseeing student clubs.
3. Commission of Education, whose duties are concerned with the continuing evaluation and improvement of teaching
and learning and of the conditions that influence the academic experience. Specific examples can include, but are
not limited to, managing the Writing Center, creating a student tutor system, and participating in Academics
Committee meetings.
4. Commission of Protection, whose duties are concerned with the enforcement of the standards of the school-community
and the promotion of environmental protection. Specific examples can include, but are not limited to, reporting
attendance at mandatory meetings and issuing Records for unexcused absences at such meetings, organizing and
carrying out campus recycling, and discouraging littering, and managing matters surrounding the American flag(s)
flown on campus. Members of the commission are, in a special sense, guardians of the rights, values, principles, and
ideals set out in this Constitution. The preferred method of enforcement of such standards is persuasion. However,
where persuasion does not prove successful, the commission may take more stringent measures.
5. Commission of Recreation, whose duties are concerned with the continuing evaluation and improvement of wholesome
recreational activities in the school-community. Specific examples can include, but are not limited to, organizing
school dances, planning Winter Formal, and leading activities that promote school spirit.
6. Commission of Services, whose duties are concerned with the continuing evaluation and improvement of the range of
needed services in the school-community. The most evident example of this duty is the operation of the student
store.
7. Commission of Boarding, whose duties are concerned with the continuing evaluation and improvement of dormitory
life, which involves the facilitation and execution of dormitory administration such as maintenance and rule
enforcement. The Commission is to be elected from and by the boarding student community as outlined in Article VII.
8. Deputies, who are students installed by a specific Commission to aid in the execution of its duties and to expand
community participation in Government. Each Commission may have up to three Deputies, with the exception of
Commissioners of Boarding, who may have up to two deputies in each dormitory. No one in any of the Council
offices may become a Deputy, and Deputies may serve only one Commission. Deputies are nominated by the
Commission and must be approved individually by the Council. The Commission or the Council may remove a Deputy
at any time; when a Commission leaves office, the Deputies of that Commission also leave their posts. Deputies do
not have a vote in the Council but are strongly encouraged to attend Council meetings.
9. Class Representatives, whose duties are concerned with the continuing evaluation of opinions and desires of their
respective classes. Class Representatives are responsible for organizing and voicing class concerns to the Council
and for taking attendance for their respective grades at mandatory meetings. Each class will elect one or two
representatives from its own class and for its own class.
10. The Council Secretary, whose duties are concerned with the documentation and communication of recent plans,
updates, and discussions mentioned during Student Government and Town Meetings and contributing to task
management within the Council. Specific examples can include, but are not limited to, taking notes during Council
meetings, taking notes during Town Meetings, and assisting the Mayor in certain projects. These notes must be
reviewed and approved by the Council before their release. The Council Secretary does not have a vote in the
Council. The Council Secretary is nominated by the Mayor and must be approved individually by the Council through a
⅔majority vote.
II. Additional responsibilities of the Council:
1. Each office of the Council must prepare a written platform, a program of action to be implemented during the specified
term of office. This platform should present the goals and methodology for the office.
2. The Council should hold regular meetings to discuss and evaluate ongoing programs. The meetings are compulsory for
all members unless a viable excuse is given. Embracing the principles of democracy, all members of the school
community are encouraged to attend Council meetings.
3. The Council must, at times, make decisions on items such as those called for in this Constitution. In order to make
these decisions, the Council must vote. Three-quarters of the Council constitutes a quorum, and decisions will be
made by a two-thirds majority vote.
4. The Council must administer elections at the end of each semester, as outlined in Article VII.
5. The Mayor has final responsibility for the effectiveness of the Council, and the Director of Indian Springs School has
final responsibility for the effectiveness of the Faculty Liaisons, which are mentor Faculty members assigned to
each Commission and Class. It is the duty of the Mayor and Director to see that the Commissions and Liaisons
develop a unified program in order to improve specific aspects of the school-community from the vantage point of
a comprehensive view of school-community problems.
Article V – The Judiciary
The Indian Springs School Judiciary is a panel elected entirely by the students for the purpose of hearing and ruling on
infractions of policies, rules, and standards within the school-community. The Judiciary is composed of eleven students and
one Faculty Liaison. The eleven-member panel must be composed of one 8th (for the second semester only), one 9th, one
10th, one 11th, and one 12th grader as well as two boarding students, elected by popular vote by the entire student body.
Once these stipulations have been met, the remaining spots will be filled by those receiving the highest number of votes. Any
student who wishes to run for the Judiciary is both welcome and encouraged to do so. The Faculty has no input regarding
who is allowed to run.
I. Offices of Judiciary
There are two offices of Judiciary: the Head of Judiciary and the Student Recorder. Both positions are elected at the first
Judiciary meeting following general elections by a combined panel of incoming and outgoing members of the Judiciary. Voting
is anonymous, and offices are decided by majority vote.
1. The Head of Judiciary is the leader of the panel and serves as a guide and moderator during discussions rather than a
member advocating their own opinions. The Head of Judiciary has no vote during regular meetings except in the case of a tie,
where they serve as a tiebreaker. In order to run for Head of Judiciary, a student must have previously served at least one
term on the panel, if there is such a person. The Head of Judiciary is responsible for organizing meeting times, bringing a
copy of the Read ‘n’ Heed, Records, and precedents to every meeting, taking attendance at meetings, and notifying the
accused of the accused offense as well as the date, time, and location of the hearing. After each hearing, it is the Head’s
responsibility to provide the Dean of Student Life with a report of all cases, rulings, and work hours or other punishments
given.
2. The Student Recorder keeps an accurate record of the decisions made by the Judiciary and serves as the
Impeachment Recorder during the impeachment of a Council member as outlined in Article VIII. In the event of the Head of
Judiciary receiving a Record, the Student Recorder assumes the role of Head of Judiciary for that case.
II. The Faculty Liaison
The Faculty Liaison to the Judiciary is the Faculty’s representation on the panel. They serve only as a guide; students
maintain the primary responsibility and control of the Judiciary. The Faculty Liaison may voice an opinion, act as a clarifier
and interpreter of the rules, and assist in interrogating the accused. They may not vote during regular meetings or during
the election of offices. The Faculty Liaison is responsible for creating a written memo of all proceedings of the Judiciary to
distribute to the Director, the Dean of Academics, the Dean of Student Life, and the Dean of Residential Life. The Faculty
Liaison is expected to abide by all policies, rules, and procedures of the Judiciary.
III. The Dean of Student Life
The Dean of Student Life is not a member of the Judiciary and is not present during meetings; they serve as an outside
assistant in executing the administrative duties of the Judiciary. After each meeting, an outline of all decisions, including a
breakdown of the work hours and/or other punishments and their corresponding offenses, is given to the Dean of Student
Life by the Head of Judiciary. The Dean of Student Life is responsible for notifying each student and their Faculty Advisor of
the work hour assignment and/or other punishment given by the Judiciary. It is the Dean of Student Life’s responsibility to
keep track of work hours performed and time frames for other punishments for each student. When a Faculty member
submits a record, they are to be informed of the case’s outcome by the Dean of Student Life.
IV. Judiciary Procedure
Persuasion is the primary means of enforcement of the rules in the school-community. However, acknowledging that a
warning may not alter behavior in all situations, a Record may be issued after persuasion has been attempted. Any member of
the community may write a Record to report a rule infraction. Records are submitted to the Head of Judiciary through email.
In the Record, the accuser should provide a detailed written explanation of the situation along with any other relevant
information. If there is not enough information from the accuser to prove guilt, the accused should be deemed innocent. Prior
to the
hearing, the Head of Judiciary may ask the accuser if there is more information associated with the record. The responsibility
for providing details falls on the accuser in order for the Judiciary to remain the jury rather than the prosecutor. The accuser
may choose to remain anonymous during the proceedings of the hearing. The accuser should provide all relevant information
in the original record, but may request to attend the hearing if he or she would like to provide additional information. When a
Record is submitted, the Head will alert the Judiciary, the accused, and the accuser (when necessary) of the date, time, and
location of the hearing. Meetings should be called as regularly as possible. Six members of the Judiciary other than the Head
must be present to constitute a quorum.
The accused must appear before the Judiciary on the specified day. If the accused does not do so and does not provide a
viable excuse, they will automatically be given a set punishment. On the day of the hearing, the Head will read the Record
aloud and explain the case to the Judiciary. The Judiciary will then summon and question the accused concerning all aspects
of the case and any connected incidents. Upon completion, the accused will leave the room. Only the eleven members of the
Judiciary and the Faculty Liaison are allowed to be present during deliberation. The panel must first determine if the accused is
innocent or guilty. The accused is considered innocent until proven guilty. If the accused is deemed guilty, the precedent
system—a written record of past rule infractions and their correlating punishments—will be used as a guide during the
deliberation of punishment. However, due to the uniqueness of each case, the precedent system should not necessarily be
followed. Finally, the Judiciary will set a punishment by majority vote. If at any point during the process the Judiciary
determines it has inadequate information, the panel reserves the right to postpone a case until more information has been
gathered from relevant parties. The accused may also be summoned for additional questioning for clarification.
On the following school day, the accused must report to the Dean of Student Life to receive their punishment. If work
hours were assigned, the accused must then contact the appropriate adult to establish a schedule for the completion of the
work hours. If the work hours are not completed within the set time period, the accused will be charged with “work hour
delinquency,” and the uncompleted number of hours shall be doubled automatically. If the accused vehemently maintains their
innocence yet is given work hours, they have the right to formally submit an appeal by email to the Judiciary. After the Dean
of Student Life and the Director are notified of the petition, the Judiciary will hold another hearing to reexamine evidence and
question relevant parties.
Strict confidentiality must be maintained throughout the entire Judiciary process.
V. Judiciary Rules
1. All Judiciary members and the Faculty Liaison must act with seriousness of purpose, maintain respectful conduct, and
lead by example. This is of the utmost importance to the effectiveness of the Judiciary, which must maintain the
respect of the community to function properly.
2. All Judiciary members have equal say and power regardless of age or experience.
3. Those hearing the case and receiving summary memos must maintain the confidentiality of all proceedings and
outcomes. There will be no discussion of the decision-making process in front of the accused. Only the accused has
the right to discuss the Judiciary’s decision; it is that person’s decision alone to discuss their case.
4. If a Judiciary member is responsible for issuing a record, that member will not vote on that case or be present for its
deliberation.
5. If a Judiciary member receives a Record, that member may not be present during the deliberation of the case.
6. Personal bias of any kind against anyone may not affect the vote or discussion of a case. If a panel member feels
unable to ignore a bias, they should recuse themselves from the case.
7. If the accused is found guilty of breaking a rule, even if members of the Judiciary disagree with the rule, the Judiciary
must punish it accordingly.
8. The Judiciary is responsible for punishing any rule infractions that are uncovered during a hearing.
9. The Judiciary must meet at least once per term for a self-evaluation and discussion of any necessary changes to these
rules and the procedures herein.
10. The Judiciary may not assign cruel or unusual punishments.
11. Judiciary members are expected to attend every meeting. A member is allowed one unexcused absence before
being removed from the panel. A member is allowed four excused absences. At the fourth absence, if the absences
are deemed disruptive to the panel’s functioning, the Head of Judiciary will conduct a vote regarding the removal of
the member. In the case of any vacancy, a special election must be held as outlined in Article VII.
12. All Judiciary members must abide by these rules and procedures or be removed from the Judiciary.
Article VI – Measures Governing Behavior
The price of freedom is responsibility embodied by self-restraint and obligation. Regulations are put forth by the
Administration, the Faculty, and the Students to maintain the community’s values and the balance of freedom and
responsibility. The specific regulations can be found in the Reed-N-Heed.
I. Administrative Policies
Administrative policies are limited to issues deemed particularly significant by the Director. They are related to the
advancement of the school’s mission and the protection of the school’s good name. The development of these policies is
the responsibility of the Director alone.
II. Faculty Policies
Faculty policies are the rules and policies deemed to be significant by the Faculty. In general, they are concerned with
the school’s operation and the safety and well being of the student body. While the Faculty has the final say in the
development of Faculty Policy, students have the right to propose any revisions they see fit. Any Faculty member may
propose an amendment to the Faculty Policy. The proposed alteration is taken to the Faculty to be voted on. The
Administration may veto a proposed policy.
Note to Sections I and II:
The Administration and Faculty pledge to hear student opinion relating to the formulation of policies
that concern students, but they reserve the right to make decisions independent of the majority
opinion of students. While the Administration and Faculty are obligated to explain to the students the
reasoning behind actions taken, students’ opinions do not affect a policy’s introduction into the
Read-N-Heed.
III. Student Standards
In keeping with a commitment to the widest possible student participation in government, the Faculty shall designate
realms of the school-community in which students shall be free to govern as described in the Read-N-Heed. Such areas are
intended to develop in students a sense of duty in the exercise of freedom. The designation of Student Standards assumes
close cooperation between Faculty and Students. Students should only petition the Faculty for such designation after sufficient
prior cooperative thinking and planning by representatives of the Faculty and Council. Both Faculty and Students are
responsible for creating a favorable and supportive atmosphere when Students petition to claim a standard. The Faculty shall
refrain from transferring a Faculty Policy to Students unless there is evidence of widespread desire on the part of Students to
undertake responsible management of that area. There should be ongoing discussion between Faculty and Students regarding
the management of an assumed Standard. Faculty may not mandate changes in Standards or in Student enforcement
procedures of the Standards. It is the Faculty’s duty to re-assume control of a Student Standard if students fail to show
responsibility in their governance of that area. In withdrawing a designation of a Student Standard, the Faculty will give its
reasons first to the Council, and then to the Town Meeting, but there is no implication of a right to veto by either group.
The preferred means of enforcement of all Student Standards is persuasion, which if ineffective, may be followed by
a Record as outlined in Article V.
Student Standards are formulated by the following procedure:
Students should initiate an inquiry into the possibility of assuming responsibility for an area, or Faculty may encourage
students to assume responsibility for an area. Any student, in consultation with any member of the school-community they
choose, writes a proposal for standards or revisions to be implemented in the area in question. Faculty may also propose
changes to existing standards. There will be small group discussions of the proposed standards and means of enforcement.
The final proposal is then submitted to and reviewed by the Council. The Council will then hold a vote. If the proposed
revision passes the Council, the revisions will then be voted on in a Faculty meeting. Representatives from the Council should
attend the Faculty meeting in order to maintain thorough communication. If it passes the Faculty, the proposed Standards
must be presented in a Town Meeting and voted on for final approval. For the amendment to pass the Council, Faculty, and
Town Meeting, the revisions must have a two-thirds majority support of each. If the consultation procedure does not produce
widespread commitment to the proposal on the part of students, the Mayor will remand the matter to the originating group for
further consideration.
At the beginning of the school year, the Council should review existing standards and present them to the Town
Meeting (or to small groups) for consideration and possible revision. Standards of the preceding year are in effect until this
is done.
Article VII – Elections
In order for a democracy to survive, it must be self-perpetuating through the orderly and fair transition of power by
means of open elections.
1. Elections for the Council and the Judiciary will be held biannually near the end of each semester.
2. Only students are allowed to vote in elections. Every student, regardless of circumstance, is allowed and encouraged
to vote.
3. The Faculty has no input in who is allowed to run. Any student may run for a position regardless of circumstance.
4. In order to run for a public office, students must petition. The Council will specify and publicize the nature of the
petition for each office. Petitions for Mayor and Commissions must include platforms and signatures as defined
in Article IV and the Council is responsible for making all platforms public.
5. While students may run for only one office in the Council, they are permitted to run for the Judiciary in addition to an
office in the Council.
6. Each candidate is entrusted with using their best judgment in carrying out a campaign, should they choose to have
one. All campaign material must be appropriate and aimed at positively portraying a candidate rather than negatively
portraying a competitor. The Council may vote to disqualify a candidate who has deviated from these requirements.
7. A special Town Meeting will be held prior to each election day in which candidates may make speeches presenting their
platforms. The Council will administer this Town Meeting and make public the agenda thereof before the meeting.
8. Voting will be by secret ballot after the special Town Meeting. The Council must determine the optimal method to
conduct a fair and impartial voting process, which should be made public before voting commences. The Council
may appoint other students and Faculty members to assist them.
9. The Council will tally the votes and may appoint other students and Faculty members to assist them. The numerical
statistics are to be kept completely confidential, with only the results of the election posted and not the number of
votes each candidate received.
10. Election is by an Alternative Vote. Voters will be given the option to rank the candidates in order of First Choice,
Second Choice, etc. If the candidate with the highest number of First Choice votes obtains a majority, they win the
election. If said candidate does not receive a majority of all votes cast, the candidate with the lowest number of
First Option votes will drop out and their votes will transfer to each respective voter’s Second Choice. This process
will repeat automatically until there is a clear majority winner.
11. If less than three-quarters of the student body participates in the election, there will be a re-election. Elections for
the Commission of Boarding will require three-quarters participation from the boarding student community.
12. No candidate for an election may assist in the election process. Therefore, Council members who plan to run in the
election may neither participate in decisions that the Council makes concerning the election nor assist in
administering the voting or counting.
13. The Council must choose the members who are primarily responsible for conducting the election process. Usually,
this duty is allotted to either the Commission of Citizenship or the Commission of Protection. However, if students
holding both Commissions plan to run for office, the Council must elect two impartial council members to run the
election.
14. In the case of a vacancy in the offices of the Mayor or the Commissions, the Town Meeting must decide by a two
thirds majority vote whether or not the vacancy should be filled. In the case of a vacancy in the offices of the
Class Representatives, the relevant Class Meeting will decide by a two-thirds majority vote whether or not the
vacancy should be filled. If it is decided that a vacancy should be filled, the normal election procedure will take
place. If a vacancy should arise in the Judiciary, the vacancy must be filled by a special election.
Article VIII – Impeachment of Elected Officials
Any member of the Indian Springs school-community can suggest the impeachment of an elected student official.
There are separate processes for the impeachment and removal of students from various offices.
I. Students holding the offices of the Council may be accused and impeached by the following process:
1. The accuser must present the proposal of impeachment to the Judiciary, either in person or in writing, giving specific
reasons for impeachment. The accuser has the option to remain anonymous.
2. The Judiciary will install the Student Recorder as the Impeachment Recorder to record the arguments and proceedings
of the impeachment trial. If the Student Recorder is unable to be impartial, another member of the Judiciary may be
elected by majority vote to be the Impeachment Recorder.
3. The Judiciary can decide on the manner in which to conduct the trial but must hear both the accuser’s and the
accused’s arguments. Based on the trial, the Judiciary will decide by majority vote whether or not the
proposed impeachment should continue to the Town Meeting or the Class Meeting.
4. If the Judiciary decides to advance the impeachment case of a Class Representative, then the case will go to the
respective Class Meeting. Cases for all other Council offices will advance to the Town Meeting. The proceedings in
the preliminary stages (outlined in a, b, and c) are to remain completely confidential even after the Town Meeting
or the Class Meeting, if one is held. Only the information and arguments that the Judiciary deems important
enough for the Impeachment Recorder to present in public meetings may be disclosed, in the case of a Town
Meeting or Class Meeting. Only the Impeachment Recorder may present such information.
5. The Impeachment Recorder must make a presentation to the Town Meeting if the accused is a Mayor or
Commissioner, or to the Class Meeting if the accused is a Class Representative. This presentation should include the
accusations against the official and the accused official’s defense in an equal and unbiased manner. Students in the
Town Meeting or Class Meeting will then vote by secret ballot on whether or not to remove the impeached official
from office. If the impeachment passes the Town Meeting or Class Meeting by a two-thirds majority, the official will
be removed from office immediately.
6. The vacancy procedure outlined in Article VII will determine whether or not a special election will be held.
II. Students holding chairs on the Judiciary may be accused and impeached by the following process:
1. The accuser must present the proposal of impeachment to the Council, either in person or in writing, giving specific
reasons for impeachment. The accuser has the option to remain anonymous.
2. The Council must elect by majority vote an impartial member of the Council to be the Impeachment Recorder to record
the arguments and proceedings of the impeachment trial.
3. The Council can decide on the manner in which to conduct the trial but must hear both the accuser’s and the accused’s
arguments. Based on the trial, the Council will decide by a two-thirds majority vote whether or not the proposed
impeachment should continue to the Town Meeting.
4. The proceedings in the preliminary stages (outlined in a, b, and c) are to remain completely confidential even after the
Town Meeting, if one is held. Only the information and arguments that the Council deems important enough for the
Impeachment Recorder to present in a public meeting may be disclosed, in the case of a Town Meeting. Only the
Impeachment Recorder may present such information.
5. The Impeachment Recorder must present the accusations against the official and the defenses of the accused to the
Town Meeting in an equal and unbiased manner. Students will then vote by secret ballot on whether or not to
remove the impeached official from office. If the impeachment passes the Town Meeting by a two-thirds majority,
the official will be removed from office immediately.
6. In the case that a Judiciary member is impeached, there must be a special election to fill the vacancy.
Article IX – Amendments
Provided that every member of the school-community has the power and obligation to improve it through constructive
change, any person may submit a proposal to amend the Constitution at any time during the academic year. The proposed
amendment must first be submitted to and reviewed by the Council. The Council will hold a vote. If the proposed
amendment passes the Council, the revisions will then go to a Faculty meeting to be voted on. Representatives from the
Council should attend the Faculty meeting in order to maintain thorough communication. If it passes the Faculty, the
revisions must be presented in a Town Meeting and voted on for final approval. For the amendment to pass the Council,
Faculty, and Town
Meeting, the revisions must have two-thirds majority support of each. If at any point significant revisions are made to
an amendment, the process will begin again with the Council’s review.
The Indian Springs School Constitution
Preamble
Under the freedom granted the faculty and students of Indian Springs School by the Board of Governors of the
Alabama Educational Foundation, the governing body of Indian Springs School, there is herewith created the official Indian
Springs School Constitution.
The purpose of the Indian Springs School Constitution and Government is to promote living and learning in accordance
with humane and democratic values and principles, thereby contributing to the intellectual, physical, emotional, spiritual, and
ethical development of all members of the Indian Springs school-community.
In establishing this Constitution, the members of the Indian Springs school-community affirm that students and teachers
do not have to accept themselves or their surroundings as they are but that it is within their power to improve both through
participation in constructive change. Such participation enhances the worth and dignity of humankind, develops responsibility,
and leads persons to the realization of latent powers.
Article I – School-Community Life
The school-community exists for the purpose of providing an environment in which each individual can develop to his
or her full stature.
I. Rights
Each individual has certain rights that are equal for each person. Individuals are guaranteed maximum freedom so long
as they do not infringe upon the rights of others or threaten the general welfare of the school-community.
This Constitution guarantees:
1. The right to freedom of religion, speech, inquiry, and criticism.
2. The right of students to select representatives in the government.
3. The right of students to run for public office.
4. The right to petition the Council or Faculty.
5. The right to assemble peacefully.
6. The right to be considered innocent until proven guilty.
II. Values and Ideals
Certain values and ideals are prized because they contribute to making the school-community a better place in which to
live and learn. Each individual is responsible for working toward the realization of these values and ideals.
In our school-community, we aspire to:
1. Show respect towards the opinions and beliefs of others.
2. Develop genuine friendships.
3. Respect the worth and dignity of the individual.
4. Widen the area of common agreement by which decisions are made and actions taken.
5. Develop personal integrity and moral courage.
6. Help individuals to develop their talents and skills.
7. Stimulate individuals to give direct, unselfish service to the school-community.
8. Reflect disapproval of behavior wherein one individual does or says things harmful to another or to the good name of
the school.
9. Prohibit any organized group that divides or tends to divide the school-community.
We encourage individuals to:
1. Accept their political responsibilities.
2. Keep informed about school-community jobs because the general welfare requires it.
3. Voice opinions and demands directly to the proper officials.
4. Use democratic methods to achieve group agreement.
5. Consider the common good before group or personal liberties.
6. Live in accordance with agreed-upon standards.
7. Evaluate the school-community continuously in an effort to improve it.
Article II – Structure of the Government
The divisions of government are:
1. The Director of Indian Springs School, who is appointed by the Board of Governors.
2. The Administration.
3. The Faculty.
4. The Student Government:
a. Town Meeting: a legislative body comprised of all students that, second to the Administration and Faculty, is the
authority of government at Indian Springs.
b. Council: an executive body comprised of the Mayor, the Commissions, and the Class Representatives. c.
Judiciary: a judicial body comprised of students who hear and rule on infractions of policies, rules, and standards.
Article III – Town Meeting
The heart of the Government at Indian Springs School is the Town Meeting. Town Meeting is open to all citizens and
has three main functions:
1. The Town Meeting serves as the legislative branch of Government and is the final authority on all issues in which the
Faculty is neutral. While the Town Meeting is open to all citizens, only students are allowed to vote. Three-quarters
of the student body constitutes a quorum. Decisions will be made by at least a two-thirds majority vote. The
presiding officer will determine whether the voting will be secret or public.
2. The Town Meeting serves as an open forum in which students can freely voice their concerns and opinions about
pressing issues in an effort to improve the overall quality of life in the school-community.
3. The Town Meeting is a means of communication among all citizens of the school-community. Because a democracy
cannot survive unless its citizens remain consistently informed, weekly meetings are encouraged; however, the
frequency of meetings is determined by need.
Town Meetings are called either by the Mayor with the consent of the Faculty or by the Faculty. Students have the right to
request to have a Town Meeting either through the Council, Faculty, or Director. The Mayor has the right to call a
students-only Town Meeting.
The presiding officer of the Town Meeting is the Mayor. In the absence of the Mayor, the Council will designate a presiding
officer. However, if the Town Meeting is called by the Faculty, the Director or someone designated by the Faculty may take
charge of the meeting.
Article IV – The Council
The Council is a body of students elected entirely by the students for the purpose of providing leadership in the
community. The most important responsibility of the Council is to assess the quality of school-community life and improve it
on as many levels as possible.
I. The offices of the Council are:
1. The Mayor, whose duty is to provide leadership for the Council and the community as a whole in building a greater
understanding of the aims and purposes of the community and to bring about the realization of these aims and
purposes through the various Council offices. The Mayor is responsible for seeing that each Council office fulfills
its respective duties and platforms and for coordinating the work of the Council.
2. Commission of Citizenship, whose duties are concerned with the continuing evaluation of the quality of citizenship as
exhibited on a day-to-day basis, in and out of the classroom, and in the larger community beyond the boundaries
of Indian Springs School. Specific examples can include, but are not limited to, organizing Development Day,
promoting service opportunities, and overseeing student clubs.
3. Commission of Education, whose duties are concerned with the continuing evaluation and improvement of teaching
and learning and of the conditions that influence the academic experience. Specific examples can include, but are
not limited to, managing the Writing Center, creating a student tutor system, and participating in Academics
Committee meetings.
4. Commission of Protection, whose duties are concerned with the enforcement of the standards of the school-community
and the promotion of environmental protection. Specific examples can include, but are not limited to, reporting
attendance at mandatory meetings and issuing Records for unexcused absences at such meetings, organizing and
carrying out campus recycling, and discouraging littering, and managing matters surrounding the American flag(s)
flown on campus. Members of the commission are, in a special sense, guardians of the rights, values, principles, and
ideals set out in this Constitution. The preferred method of enforcement of such standards is persuasion. However,
where persuasion does not prove successful, the commission may take more stringent measures.
5. Commission of Recreation, whose duties are concerned with the continuing evaluation and improvement of wholesome
recreational activities in the school-community. Specific examples can include, but are not limited to, organizing
school dances, planning Winter Formal, and leading activities that promote school spirit.
6. Commission of Services, whose duties are concerned with the continuing evaluation and improvement of the range of
needed services in the school-community. The most evident example of this duty is the operation of the student
store.
7. Commission of Boarding, whose duties are concerned with the continuing evaluation and improvement of dormitory
life, which involves the facilitation and execution of dormitory administration such as maintenance and rule
enforcement. The Commission is to be elected from and by the boarding student community as outlined in Article VII.
8. Deputies, who are students installed by a specific Commission to aid in the execution of its duties and to expand
community participation in Government. Each Commission may have up to three Deputies, with the exception of
Commissioners of Boarding, who may have up to two deputies in each dormitory. No one in any of the Council
offices may become a Deputy, and Deputies may serve only one Commission. Deputies are nominated by the
Commission and must be approved individually by the Council. The Commission or the Council may remove a Deputy
at any time; when a Commission leaves office, the Deputies of that Commission also leave their posts. Deputies do
not have a vote in the Council but are strongly encouraged to attend Council meetings.
9. Class Representatives, whose duties are concerned with the continuing evaluation of opinions and desires of their
respective classes. Class Representatives are responsible for organizing and voicing class concerns to the Council
and for taking attendance for their respective grades at mandatory meetings. Each class will elect one or two
representatives from its own class and for its own class.
10. The Council Secretary, whose duties are concerned with the documentation and communication of recent plans,
updates, and discussions mentioned during Student Government and Town Meetings and contributing to task
management within the Council. Specific examples can include, but are not limited to, taking notes during Council
meetings, taking notes during Town Meetings, and assisting the Mayor in certain projects. These notes must be
reviewed and approved by the Council before their release. The Council Secretary does not have a vote in the
Council. The Council Secretary is nominated by the Mayor and must be approved individually by the Council through a
⅔majority vote.
II. Additional responsibilities of the Council:
1. Each office of the Council must prepare a written platform, a program of action to be implemented during the specified
term of office. This platform should present the goals and methodology for the office.
2. The Council should hold regular meetings to discuss and evaluate ongoing programs. The meetings are compulsory for
all members unless a viable excuse is given. Embracing the principles of democracy, all members of the school
community are encouraged to attend Council meetings.
3. The Council must, at times, make decisions on items such as those called for in this Constitution. In order to make
these decisions, the Council must vote. Three-quarters of the Council constitutes a quorum, and decisions will be
made by a two-thirds majority vote.
4. The Council must administer elections at the end of each semester, as outlined in Article VII.
5. The Mayor has final responsibility for the effectiveness of the Council, and the Director of Indian Springs School has
final responsibility for the effectiveness of the Faculty Liaisons, which are mentor Faculty members assigned to
each Commission and Class. It is the duty of the Mayor and Director to see that the Commissions and Liaisons
develop a unified program in order to improve specific aspects of the school-community from the vantage point of
a comprehensive view of school-community problems.
Article V – The Judiciary
The Indian Springs School Judiciary is a panel elected entirely by the students for the purpose of hearing and ruling on
infractions of policies, rules, and standards within the school-community. The Judiciary is composed of eleven students and
one Faculty Liaison. The eleven-member panel must be composed of one 8th (for the second semester only), one 9th, one
10th, one 11th, and one 12th grader as well as two boarding students, elected by popular vote by the entire student body.
Once these stipulations have been met, the remaining spots will be filled by those receiving the highest number of votes. Any
student who wishes to run for the Judiciary is both welcome and encouraged to do so. The Faculty has no input regarding
who is allowed to run.
I. Offices of Judiciary
There are two offices of Judiciary: the Head of Judiciary and the Student Recorder. Both positions are elected at the first
Judiciary meeting following general elections by a combined panel of incoming and outgoing members of the Judiciary. Voting
is anonymous, and offices are decided by majority vote.
1. The Head of Judiciary is the leader of the panel and serves as a guide and moderator during discussions rather than a
member advocating their own opinions. The Head of Judiciary has no vote during regular meetings except in the case of a tie,
where they serve as a tiebreaker. In order to run for Head of Judiciary, a student must have previously served at least one
term on the panel, if there is such a person. The Head of Judiciary is responsible for organizing meeting times, bringing a
copy of the Read ‘n’ Heed, Records, and precedents to every meeting, taking attendance at meetings, and notifying the
accused of the accused offense as well as the date, time, and location of the hearing. After each hearing, it is the Head’s
responsibility to provide the Dean of Student Life with a report of all cases, rulings, and work hours or other punishments
given.
2. The Student Recorder keeps an accurate record of the decisions made by the Judiciary and serves as the
Impeachment Recorder during the impeachment of a Council member as outlined in Article VIII. In the event of the Head of
Judiciary receiving a Record, the Student Recorder assumes the role of Head of Judiciary for that case.
II. The Faculty Liaison
The Faculty Liaison to the Judiciary is the Faculty’s representation on the panel. They serve only as a guide; students
maintain the primary responsibility and control of the Judiciary. The Faculty Liaison may voice an opinion, act as a clarifier
and interpreter of the rules, and assist in interrogating the accused. They may not vote during regular meetings or during
the election of offices. The Faculty Liaison is responsible for creating a written memo of all proceedings of the Judiciary to
distribute to the Director, the Dean of Academics, the Dean of Student Life, and the Dean of Residential Life. The Faculty
Liaison is expected to abide by all policies, rules, and procedures of the Judiciary.
III. The Dean of Student Life
The Dean of Student Life is not a member of the Judiciary and is not present during meetings; they serve as an outside
assistant in executing the administrative duties of the Judiciary. After each meeting, an outline of all decisions, including a
breakdown of the work hours and/or other punishments and their corresponding offenses, is given to the Dean of Student
Life by the Head of Judiciary. The Dean of Student Life is responsible for notifying each student and their Faculty Advisor of
the work hour assignment and/or other punishment given by the Judiciary. It is the Dean of Student Life’s responsibility to
keep track of work hours performed and time frames for other punishments for each student. When a Faculty member
submits a record, they are to be informed of the case’s outcome by the Dean of Student Life.
IV. Judiciary Procedure
Persuasion is the primary means of enforcement of the rules in the school-community. However, acknowledging that a
warning may not alter behavior in all situations, a Record may be issued after persuasion has been attempted. Any member of
the community may write a Record to report a rule infraction. Records are submitted to the Head of Judiciary through email.
In the Record, the accuser should provide a detailed written explanation of the situation along with any other relevant
information. If there is not enough information from the accuser to prove guilt, the accused should be deemed innocent. Prior
to the
hearing, the Head of Judiciary may ask the accuser if there is more information associated with the record. The responsibility
for providing details falls on the accuser in order for the Judiciary to remain the jury rather than the prosecutor. The accuser
may choose to remain anonymous during the proceedings of the hearing. The accuser should provide all relevant information
in the original record, but may request to attend the hearing if he or she would like to provide additional information. When a
Record is submitted, the Head will alert the Judiciary, the accused, and the accuser (when necessary) of the date, time, and
location of the hearing. Meetings should be called as regularly as possible. Six members of the Judiciary other than the Head
must be present to constitute a quorum.
The accused must appear before the Judiciary on the specified day. If the accused does not do so and does not provide a
viable excuse, they will automatically be given a set punishment. On the day of the hearing, the Head will read the Record
aloud and explain the case to the Judiciary. The Judiciary will then summon and question the accused concerning all aspects
of the case and any connected incidents. Upon completion, the accused will leave the room. Only the eleven members of the
Judiciary and the Faculty Liaison are allowed to be present during deliberation. The panel must first determine if the accused is
innocent or guilty. The accused is considered innocent until proven guilty. If the accused is deemed guilty, the precedent
system—a written record of past rule infractions and their correlating punishments—will be used as a guide during the
deliberation of punishment. However, due to the uniqueness of each case, the precedent system should not necessarily be
followed. Finally, the Judiciary will set a punishment by majority vote. If at any point during the process the Judiciary
determines it has inadequate information, the panel reserves the right to postpone a case until more information has been
gathered from relevant parties. The accused may also be summoned for additional questioning for clarification.
On the following school day, the accused must report to the Dean of Student Life to receive their punishment. If work
hours were assigned, the accused must then contact the appropriate adult to establish a schedule for the completion of the
work hours. If the work hours are not completed within the set time period, the accused will be charged with “work hour
delinquency,” and the uncompleted number of hours shall be doubled automatically. If the accused vehemently maintains their
innocence yet is given work hours, they have the right to formally submit an appeal by email to the Judiciary. After the Dean
of Student Life and the Director are notified of the petition, the Judiciary will hold another hearing to reexamine evidence and
question relevant parties.
Strict confidentiality must be maintained throughout the entire Judiciary process.
V. Judiciary Rules
1. All Judiciary members and the Faculty Liaison must act with seriousness of purpose, maintain respectful conduct, and
lead by example. This is of the utmost importance to the effectiveness of the Judiciary, which must maintain the
respect of the community to function properly.
2. All Judiciary members have equal say and power regardless of age or experience.
3. Those hearing the case and receiving summary memos must maintain the confidentiality of all proceedings and
outcomes. There will be no discussion of the decision-making process in front of the accused. Only the accused has
the right to discuss the Judiciary’s decision; it is that person’s decision alone to discuss their case.
4. If a Judiciary member is responsible for issuing a record, that member will not vote on that case or be present for its
deliberation.
5. If a Judiciary member receives a Record, that member may not be present during the deliberation of the case.
6. Personal bias of any kind against anyone may not affect the vote or discussion of a case. If a panel member feels
unable to ignore a bias, they should recuse themselves from the case.
7. If the accused is found guilty of breaking a rule, even if members of the Judiciary disagree with the rule, the Judiciary
must punish it accordingly.
8. The Judiciary is responsible for punishing any rule infractions that are uncovered during a hearing.
9. The Judiciary must meet at least once per term for a self-evaluation and discussion of any necessary changes to these
rules and the procedures herein.
10. The Judiciary may not assign cruel or unusual punishments.
11. Judiciary members are expected to attend every meeting. A member is allowed one unexcused absence before
being removed from the panel. A member is allowed four excused absences. At the fourth absence, if the absences
are deemed disruptive to the panel’s functioning, the Head of Judiciary will conduct a vote regarding the removal of
the member. In the case of any vacancy, a special election must be held as outlined in Article VII.
12. All Judiciary members must abide by these rules and procedures or be removed from the Judiciary.
Article VI – Measures Governing Behavior
The price of freedom is responsibility embodied by self-restraint and obligation. Regulations are put forth by the
Administration, the Faculty, and the Students to maintain the community’s values and the balance of freedom and
responsibility. The specific regulations can be found in the Reed-N-Heed.
I. Administrative Policies
Administrative policies are limited to issues deemed particularly significant by the Director. They are related to the
advancement of the school’s mission and the protection of the school’s good name. The development of these policies is
the responsibility of the Director alone.
II. Faculty Policies
Faculty policies are the rules and policies deemed to be significant by the Faculty. In general, they are concerned with
the school’s operation and the safety and well being of the student body. While the Faculty has the final say in the
development of Faculty Policy, students have the right to propose any revisions they see fit. Any Faculty member may
propose an amendment to the Faculty Policy. The proposed alteration is taken to the Faculty to be voted on. The
Administration may veto a proposed policy.
Note to Sections I and II:
The Administration and Faculty pledge to hear student opinion relating to the formulation of policies
that concern students, but they reserve the right to make decisions independent of the majority
opinion of students. While the Administration and Faculty are obligated to explain to the students the
reasoning behind actions taken, students’ opinions do not affect a policy’s introduction into the
Read-N-Heed.
III. Student Standards
In keeping with a commitment to the widest possible student participation in government, the Faculty shall designate
realms of the school-community in which students shall be free to govern as described in the Read-N-Heed. Such areas are
intended to develop in students a sense of duty in the exercise of freedom. The designation of Student Standards assumes
close cooperation between Faculty and Students. Students should only petition the Faculty for such designation after sufficient
prior cooperative thinking and planning by representatives of the Faculty and Council. Both Faculty and Students are
responsible for creating a favorable and supportive atmosphere when Students petition to claim a standard. The Faculty shall
refrain from transferring a Faculty Policy to Students unless there is evidence of widespread desire on the part of Students to
undertake responsible management of that area. There should be ongoing discussion between Faculty and Students regarding
the management of an assumed Standard. Faculty may not mandate changes in Standards or in Student enforcement
procedures of the Standards. It is the Faculty’s duty to re-assume control of a Student Standard if students fail to show
responsibility in their governance of that area. In withdrawing a designation of a Student Standard, the Faculty will give its
reasons first to the Council, and then to the Town Meeting, but there is no implication of a right to veto by either group.
The preferred means of enforcement of all Student Standards is persuasion, which if ineffective, may be followed by
a Record as outlined in Article V.
Student Standards are formulated by the following procedure:
Students should initiate an inquiry into the possibility of assuming responsibility for an area, or Faculty may encourage
students to assume responsibility for an area. Any student, in consultation with any member of the school-community they
choose, writes a proposal for standards or revisions to be implemented in the area in question. Faculty may also propose
changes to existing standards. There will be small group discussions of the proposed standards and means of enforcement.
The final proposal is then submitted to and reviewed by the Council. The Council will then hold a vote. If the proposed
revision passes the Council, the revisions will then be voted on in a Faculty meeting. Representatives from the Council should
attend the Faculty meeting in order to maintain thorough communication. If it passes the Faculty, the proposed Standards
must be presented in a Town Meeting and voted on for final approval. For the amendment to pass the Council, Faculty, and
Town Meeting, the revisions must have a two-thirds majority support of each. If the consultation procedure does not produce
widespread commitment to the proposal on the part of students, the Mayor will remand the matter to the originating group for
further consideration.
At the beginning of the school year, the Council should review existing standards and present them to the Town
Meeting (or to small groups) for consideration and possible revision. Standards of the preceding year are in effect until this
is done.
Article VII – Elections
In order for a democracy to survive, it must be self-perpetuating through the orderly and fair transition of power by
means of open elections.
1. Elections for the Council and the Judiciary will be held biannually near the end of each semester.
2. Only students are allowed to vote in elections. Every student, regardless of circumstance, is allowed and encouraged
to vote.
3. The Faculty has no input in who is allowed to run. Any student may run for a position regardless of circumstance.
4. In order to run for a public office, students must petition. The Council will specify and publicize the nature of the
petition for each office. Petitions for Mayor and Commissions must include platforms and signatures as defined
in Article IV and the Council is responsible for making all platforms public.
5. While students may run for only one office in the Council, they are permitted to run for the Judiciary in addition to an
office in the Council.
6. Each candidate is entrusted with using their best judgment in carrying out a campaign, should they choose to have
one. All campaign material must be appropriate and aimed at positively portraying a candidate rather than negatively
portraying a competitor. The Council may vote to disqualify a candidate who has deviated from these requirements.
7. A special Town Meeting will be held prior to each election day in which candidates may make speeches presenting their
platforms. The Council will administer this Town Meeting and make public the agenda thereof before the meeting.
8. Voting will be by secret ballot after the special Town Meeting. The Council must determine the optimal method to
conduct a fair and impartial voting process, which should be made public before voting commences. The Council
may appoint other students and Faculty members to assist them.
9. The Council will tally the votes and may appoint other students and Faculty members to assist them. The numerical
statistics are to be kept completely confidential, with only the results of the election posted and not the number of
votes each candidate received.
10. Election is by an Alternative Vote. Voters will be given the option to rank the candidates in order of First Choice,
Second Choice, etc. If the candidate with the highest number of First Choice votes obtains a majority, they win the
election. If said candidate does not receive a majority of all votes cast, the candidate with the lowest number of
First Option votes will drop out and their votes will transfer to each respective voter’s Second Choice. This process
will repeat automatically until there is a clear majority winner.
11. If less than three-quarters of the student body participates in the election, there will be a re-election. Elections for
the Commission of Boarding will require three-quarters participation from the boarding student community.
12. No candidate for an election may assist in the election process. Therefore, Council members who plan to run in the
election may neither participate in decisions that the Council makes concerning the election nor assist in
administering the voting or counting.
13. The Council must choose the members who are primarily responsible for conducting the election process. Usually,
this duty is allotted to either the Commission of Citizenship or the Commission of Protection. However, if students
holding both Commissions plan to run for office, the Council must elect two impartial council members to run the
election.
14. In the case of a vacancy in the offices of the Mayor or the Commissions, the Town Meeting must decide by a two
thirds majority vote whether or not the vacancy should be filled. In the case of a vacancy in the offices of the
Class Representatives, the relevant Class Meeting will decide by a two-thirds majority vote whether or not the
vacancy should be filled. If it is decided that a vacancy should be filled, the normal election procedure will take
place. If a vacancy should arise in the Judiciary, the vacancy must be filled by a special election.
Article VIII – Impeachment of Elected Officials
Any member of the Indian Springs school-community can suggest the impeachment of an elected student official.
There are separate processes for the impeachment and removal of students from various offices.
I. Students holding the offices of the Council may be accused and impeached by the following process:
1. The accuser must present the proposal of impeachment to the Judiciary, either in person or in writing, giving specific
reasons for impeachment. The accuser has the option to remain anonymous.
2. The Judiciary will install the Student Recorder as the Impeachment Recorder to record the arguments and proceedings
of the impeachment trial. If the Student Recorder is unable to be impartial, another member of the Judiciary may be
elected by majority vote to be the Impeachment Recorder.
3. The Judiciary can decide on the manner in which to conduct the trial but must hear both the accuser’s and the
accused’s arguments. Based on the trial, the Judiciary will decide by majority vote whether or not the
proposed impeachment should continue to the Town Meeting or the Class Meeting.
4. If the Judiciary decides to advance the impeachment case of a Class Representative, then the case will go to the
respective Class Meeting. Cases for all other Council offices will advance to the Town Meeting. The proceedings in
the preliminary stages (outlined in a, b, and c) are to remain completely confidential even after the Town Meeting
or the Class Meeting, if one is held. Only the information and arguments that the Judiciary deems important
enough for the Impeachment Recorder to present in public meetings may be disclosed, in the case of a Town
Meeting or Class Meeting. Only the Impeachment Recorder may present such information.
5. The Impeachment Recorder must make a presentation to the Town Meeting if the accused is a Mayor or
Commissioner, or to the Class Meeting if the accused is a Class Representative. This presentation should include the
accusations against the official and the accused official’s defense in an equal and unbiased manner. Students in the
Town Meeting or Class Meeting will then vote by secret ballot on whether or not to remove the impeached official
from office. If the impeachment passes the Town Meeting or Class Meeting by a two-thirds majority, the official will
be removed from office immediately.
6. The vacancy procedure outlined in Article VII will determine whether or not a special election will be held.
II. Students holding chairs on the Judiciary may be accused and impeached by the following process:
1. The accuser must present the proposal of impeachment to the Council, either in person or in writing, giving specific
reasons for impeachment. The accuser has the option to remain anonymous.
2. The Council must elect by majority vote an impartial member of the Council to be the Impeachment Recorder to record
the arguments and proceedings of the impeachment trial.
3. The Council can decide on the manner in which to conduct the trial but must hear both the accuser’s and the accused’s
arguments. Based on the trial, the Council will decide by a two-thirds majority vote whether or not the proposed
impeachment should continue to the Town Meeting.
4. The proceedings in the preliminary stages (outlined in a, b, and c) are to remain completely confidential even after the
Town Meeting, if one is held. Only the information and arguments that the Council deems important enough for the
Impeachment Recorder to present in a public meeting may be disclosed, in the case of a Town Meeting. Only the
Impeachment Recorder may present such information.
5. The Impeachment Recorder must present the accusations against the official and the defenses of the accused to the
Town Meeting in an equal and unbiased manner. Students will then vote by secret ballot on whether or not to
remove the impeached official from office. If the impeachment passes the Town Meeting by a two-thirds majority,
the official will be removed from office immediately.
6. In the case that a Judiciary member is impeached, there must be a special election to fill the vacancy.
Article IX – Amendments
Provided that every member of the school-community has the power and obligation to improve it through constructive
change, any person may submit a proposal to amend the Constitution at any time during the academic year. The proposed
amendment must first be submitted to and reviewed by the Council. The Council will hold a vote. If the proposed
amendment passes the Council, the revisions will then go to a Faculty meeting to be voted on. Representatives from the
Council should attend the Faculty meeting in order to maintain thorough communication. If it passes the Faculty, the
revisions must be presented in a Town Meeting and voted on for final approval. For the amendment to pass the Council,
Faculty, and Town
Meeting, the revisions must have two-thirds majority support of each. If at any point significant revisions are made to
an amendment, the process will begin again with the Council’s review.
The Indian Springs School Constitution
Preamble
Under the freedom granted the faculty and students of Indian Springs School by the Board of Governors of the
Alabama Educational Foundation, the governing body of Indian Springs School, there is herewith created the official Indian
Springs School Constitution.
The purpose of the Indian Springs School Constitution and Government is to promote living and learning in accordance
with humane and democratic values and principles, thereby contributing to the intellectual, physical, emotional, spiritual, and
ethical development of all members of the Indian Springs school-community.
In establishing this Constitution, the members of the Indian Springs school-community affirm that students and teachers
do not have to accept themselves or their surroundings as they are but that it is within their power to improve both through
participation in constructive change. Such participation enhances the worth and dignity of humankind, develops responsibility,
and leads persons to the realization of latent powers.
Article I – School-Community Life
The school-community exists for the purpose of providing an environment in which each individual can develop to his
or her full stature.
I. Rights
Each individual has certain rights that are equal for each person. Individuals are guaranteed maximum freedom so long
as they do not infringe upon the rights of others or threaten the general welfare of the school-community.
This Constitution guarantees:
1. The right to freedom of religion, speech, inquiry, and criticism.
2. The right of students to select representatives in the government.
3. The right of students to run for public office.
4. The right to petition the Council or Faculty.
5. The right to assemble peacefully.
6. The right to be considered innocent until proven guilty.
II. Values and Ideals
Certain values and ideals are prized because they contribute to making the school-community a better place in which to
live and learn. Each individual is responsible for working toward the realization of these values and ideals.
In our school-community, we aspire to:
1. Show respect towards the opinions and beliefs of others.
2. Develop genuine friendships.
3. Respect the worth and dignity of the individual.
4. Widen the area of common agreement by which decisions are made and actions taken.
5. Develop personal integrity and moral courage.
6. Help individuals to develop their talents and skills.
7. Stimulate individuals to give direct, unselfish service to the school-community.
8. Reflect disapproval of behavior wherein one individual does or says things harmful to another or to the good name of
the school.
9. Prohibit any organized group that divides or tends to divide the school-community.
We encourage individuals to:
1. Accept their political responsibilities.
2. Keep informed about school-community jobs because the general welfare requires it.
3. Voice opinions and demands directly to the proper officials.
4. Use democratic methods to achieve group agreement.
5. Consider the common good before group or personal liberties.
6. Live in accordance with agreed-upon standards.
7. Evaluate the school-community continuously in an effort to improve it.
Article II – Structure of the Government
The divisions of government are:
1. The Director of Indian Springs School, who is appointed by the Board of Governors.
2. The Administration.
3. The Faculty.
4. The Student Government:
a. Town Meeting: a legislative body comprised of all students that, second to the Administration and Faculty, is the
authority of government at Indian Springs.
b. Council: an executive body comprised of the Mayor, the Commissions, and the Class Representatives. c.
Judiciary: a judicial body comprised of students who hear and rule on infractions of policies, rules, and standards.
Article III – Town Meeting
The heart of the Government at Indian Springs School is the Town Meeting. Town Meeting is open to all citizens and
has three main functions:
1. The Town Meeting serves as the legislative branch of Government and is the final authority on all issues in which the
Faculty is neutral. While the Town Meeting is open to all citizens, only students are allowed to vote. Three-quarters
of the student body constitutes a quorum. Decisions will be made by at least a two-thirds majority vote. The
presiding officer will determine whether the voting will be secret or public.
2. The Town Meeting serves as an open forum in which students can freely voice their concerns and opinions about
pressing issues in an effort to improve the overall quality of life in the school-community.
3. The Town Meeting is a means of communication among all citizens of the school-community. Because a democracy
cannot survive unless its citizens remain consistently informed, weekly meetings are encouraged; however, the
frequency of meetings is determined by need.
Town Meetings are called either by the Mayor with the consent of the Faculty or by the Faculty. Students have the right to
request to have a Town Meeting either through the Council, Faculty, or Director. The Mayor has the right to call a
students-only Town Meeting.
The presiding officer of the Town Meeting is the Mayor. In the absence of the Mayor, the Council will designate a presiding
officer. However, if the Town Meeting is called by the Faculty, the Director or someone designated by the Faculty may take
charge of the meeting.
Article IV – The Council
The Council is a body of students elected entirely by the students for the purpose of providing leadership in the
community. The most important responsibility of the Council is to assess the quality of school-community life and improve it
on as many levels as possible.
I. The offices of the Council are:
1. The Mayor, whose duty is to provide leadership for the Council and the community as a whole in building a greater
understanding of the aims and purposes of the community and to bring about the realization of these aims and
purposes through the various Council offices. The Mayor is responsible for seeing that each Council office fulfills
its respective duties and platforms and for coordinating the work of the Council.
2. Commission of Citizenship, whose duties are concerned with the continuing evaluation of the quality of citizenship as
exhibited on a day-to-day basis, in and out of the classroom, and in the larger community beyond the boundaries
of Indian Springs School. Specific examples can include, but are not limited to, organizing Development Day,
promoting service opportunities, and overseeing student clubs.
3. Commission of Education, whose duties are concerned with the continuing evaluation and improvement of teaching
and learning and of the conditions that influence the academic experience. Specific examples can include, but are
not limited to, managing the Writing Center, creating a student tutor system, and participating in Academics
Committee meetings.
4. Commission of Protection, whose duties are concerned with the enforcement of the standards of the school-community
and the promotion of environmental protection. Specific examples can include, but are not limited to, reporting
attendance at mandatory meetings and issuing Records for unexcused absences at such meetings, organizing and
carrying out campus recycling, and discouraging littering, and managing matters surrounding the American flag(s)
flown on campus. Members of the commission are, in a special sense, guardians of the rights, values, principles, and
ideals set out in this Constitution. The preferred method of enforcement of such standards is persuasion. However,
where persuasion does not prove successful, the commission may take more stringent measures.
5. Commission of Recreation, whose duties are concerned with the continuing evaluation and improvement of wholesome
recreational activities in the school-community. Specific examples can include, but are not limited to, organizing
school dances, planning Winter Formal, and leading activities that promote school spirit.
6. Commission of Services, whose duties are concerned with the continuing evaluation and improvement of the range of
needed services in the school-community. The most evident example of this duty is the operation of the student
store.
7. Commission of Boarding, whose duties are concerned with the continuing evaluation and improvement of dormitory
life, which involves the facilitation and execution of dormitory administration such as maintenance and rule
enforcement. The Commission is to be elected from and by the boarding student community as outlined in Article VII.
8. Deputies, who are students installed by a specific Commission to aid in the execution of its duties and to expand
community participation in Government. Each Commission may have up to three Deputies, with the exception of
Commissioners of Boarding, who may have up to two deputies in each dormitory. No one in any of the Council
offices may become a Deputy, and Deputies may serve only one Commission. Deputies are nominated by the
Commission and must be approved individually by the Council. The Commission or the Council may remove a Deputy
at any time; when a Commission leaves office, the Deputies of that Commission also leave their posts. Deputies do
not have a vote in the Council but are strongly encouraged to attend Council meetings.
9. Class Representatives, whose duties are concerned with the continuing evaluation of opinions and desires of their
respective classes. Class Representatives are responsible for organizing and voicing class concerns to the Council
and for taking attendance for their respective grades at mandatory meetings. Each class will elect one or two
representatives from its own class and for its own class.
10. The Council Secretary, whose duties are concerned with the documentation and communication of recent plans,
updates, and discussions mentioned during Student Government and Town Meetings and contributing to task
management within the Council. Specific examples can include, but are not limited to, taking notes during Council
meetings, taking notes during Town Meetings, and assisting the Mayor in certain projects. These notes must be
reviewed and approved by the Council before their release. The Council Secretary does not have a vote in the
Council. The Council Secretary is nominated by the Mayor and must be approved individually by the Council through a
⅔majority vote.
II. Additional responsibilities of the Council:
1. Each office of the Council must prepare a written platform, a program of action to be implemented during the specified
term of office. This platform should present the goals and methodology for the office.
2. The Council should hold regular meetings to discuss and evaluate ongoing programs. The meetings are compulsory for
all members unless a viable excuse is given. Embracing the principles of democracy, all members of the school
community are encouraged to attend Council meetings.
3. The Council must, at times, make decisions on items such as those called for in this Constitution. In order to make
these decisions, the Council must vote. Three-quarters of the Council constitutes a quorum, and decisions will be
made by a two-thirds majority vote.
4. The Council must administer elections at the end of each semester, as outlined in Article VII.
5. The Mayor has final responsibility for the effectiveness of the Council, and the Director of Indian Springs School has
final responsibility for the effectiveness of the Faculty Liaisons, which are mentor Faculty members assigned to
each Commission and Class. It is the duty of the Mayor and Director to see that the Commissions and Liaisons
develop a unified program in order to improve specific aspects of the school-community from the vantage point of
a comprehensive view of school-community problems.
Article V – The Judiciary
The Indian Springs School Judiciary is a panel elected entirely by the students for the purpose of hearing and ruling on
infractions of policies, rules, and standards within the school-community. The Judiciary is composed of eleven students and
one Faculty Liaison. The eleven-member panel must be composed of one 8th (for the second semester only), one 9th, one
10th, one 11th, and one 12th grader as well as two boarding students, elected by popular vote by the entire student body.
Once these stipulations have been met, the remaining spots will be filled by those receiving the highest number of votes. Any
student who wishes to run for the Judiciary is both welcome and encouraged to do so. The Faculty has no input regarding
who is allowed to run.
I. Offices of Judiciary
There are two offices of Judiciary: the Head of Judiciary and the Student Recorder. Both positions are elected at the first
Judiciary meeting following general elections by a combined panel of incoming and outgoing members of the Judiciary. Voting
is anonymous, and offices are decided by majority vote.
1. The Head of Judiciary is the leader of the panel and serves as a guide and moderator during discussions rather than a
member advocating their own opinions. The Head of Judiciary has no vote during regular meetings except in the case of a tie,
where they serve as a tiebreaker. In order to run for Head of Judiciary, a student must have previously served at least one
term on the panel, if there is such a person. The Head of Judiciary is responsible for organizing meeting times, bringing a
copy of the Read ‘n’ Heed, Records, and precedents to every meeting, taking attendance at meetings, and notifying the
accused of the accused offense as well as the date, time, and location of the hearing. After each hearing, it is the Head’s
responsibility to provide the Dean of Student Life with a report of all cases, rulings, and work hours or other punishments
given.
2. The Student Recorder keeps an accurate record of the decisions made by the Judiciary and serves as the
Impeachment Recorder during the impeachment of a Council member as outlined in Article VIII. In the event of the Head of
Judiciary receiving a Record, the Student Recorder assumes the role of Head of Judiciary for that case.
II. The Faculty Liaison
The Faculty Liaison to the Judiciary is the Faculty’s representation on the panel. They serve only as a guide; students
maintain the primary responsibility and control of the Judiciary. The Faculty Liaison may voice an opinion, act as a clarifier
and interpreter of the rules, and assist in interrogating the accused. They may not vote during regular meetings or during
the election of offices. The Faculty Liaison is responsible for creating a written memo of all proceedings of the Judiciary to
distribute to the Director, the Dean of Academics, the Dean of Student Life, and the Dean of Residential Life. The Faculty
Liaison is expected to abide by all policies, rules, and procedures of the Judiciary.
III. The Dean of Student Life
The Dean of Student Life is not a member of the Judiciary and is not present during meetings; they serve as an outside
assistant in executing the administrative duties of the Judiciary. After each meeting, an outline of all decisions, including a
breakdown of the work hours and/or other punishments and their corresponding offenses, is given to the Dean of Student
Life by the Head of Judiciary. The Dean of Student Life is responsible for notifying each student and their Faculty Advisor of
the work hour assignment and/or other punishment given by the Judiciary. It is the Dean of Student Life’s responsibility to
keep track of work hours performed and time frames for other punishments for each student. When a Faculty member
submits a record, they are to be informed of the case’s outcome by the Dean of Student Life.
IV. Judiciary Procedure
Persuasion is the primary means of enforcement of the rules in the school-community. However, acknowledging that a
warning may not alter behavior in all situations, a Record may be issued after persuasion has been attempted. Any member of
the community may write a Record to report a rule infraction. Records are submitted to the Head of Judiciary through email.
In the Record, the accuser should provide a detailed written explanation of the situation along with any other relevant
information. If there is not enough information from the accuser to prove guilt, the accused should be deemed innocent. Prior
to the
hearing, the Head of Judiciary may ask the accuser if there is more information associated with the record. The responsibility
for providing details falls on the accuser in order for the Judiciary to remain the jury rather than the prosecutor. The accuser
may choose to remain anonymous during the proceedings of the hearing. The accuser should provide all relevant information
in the original record, but may request to attend the hearing if he or she would like to provide additional information. When a
Record is submitted, the Head will alert the Judiciary, the accused, and the accuser (when necessary) of the date, time, and
location of the hearing. Meetings should be called as regularly as possible. Six members of the Judiciary other than the Head
must be present to constitute a quorum.
The accused must appear before the Judiciary on the specified day. If the accused does not do so and does not provide a
viable excuse, they will automatically be given a set punishment. On the day of the hearing, the Head will read the Record
aloud and explain the case to the Judiciary. The Judiciary will then summon and question the accused concerning all aspects
of the case and any connected incidents. Upon completion, the accused will leave the room. Only the eleven members of the
Judiciary and the Faculty Liaison are allowed to be present during deliberation. The panel must first determine if the accused is
innocent or guilty. The accused is considered innocent until proven guilty. If the accused is deemed guilty, the precedent
system—a written record of past rule infractions and their correlating punishments—will be used as a guide during the
deliberation of punishment. However, due to the uniqueness of each case, the precedent system should not necessarily be
followed. Finally, the Judiciary will set a punishment by majority vote. If at any point during the process the Judiciary
determines it has inadequate information, the panel reserves the right to postpone a case until more information has been
gathered from relevant parties. The accused may also be summoned for additional questioning for clarification.
On the following school day, the accused must report to the Dean of Student Life to receive their punishment. If work
hours were assigned, the accused must then contact the appropriate adult to establish a schedule for the completion of the
work hours. If the work hours are not completed within the set time period, the accused will be charged with “work hour
delinquency,” and the uncompleted number of hours shall be doubled automatically. If the accused vehemently maintains their
innocence yet is given work hours, they have the right to formally submit an appeal by email to the Judiciary. After the Dean
of Student Life and the Director are notified of the petition, the Judiciary will hold another hearing to reexamine evidence and
question relevant parties.
Strict confidentiality must be maintained throughout the entire Judiciary process.
V. Judiciary Rules
1. All Judiciary members and the Faculty Liaison must act with seriousness of purpose, maintain respectful conduct, and
lead by example. This is of the utmost importance to the effectiveness of the Judiciary, which must maintain the
respect of the community to function properly.
2. All Judiciary members have equal say and power regardless of age or experience.
3. Those hearing the case and receiving summary memos must maintain the confidentiality of all proceedings and
outcomes. There will be no discussion of the decision-making process in front of the accused. Only the accused has
the right to discuss the Judiciary’s decision; it is that person’s decision alone to discuss their case.
4. If a Judiciary member is responsible for issuing a record, that member will not vote on that case or be present for its
deliberation.
5. If a Judiciary member receives a Record, that member may not be present during the deliberation of the case.
6. Personal bias of any kind against anyone may not affect the vote or discussion of a case. If a panel member feels
unable to ignore a bias, they should recuse themselves from the case.
7. If the accused is found guilty of breaking a rule, even if members of the Judiciary disagree with the rule, the Judiciary
must punish it accordingly.
8. The Judiciary is responsible for punishing any rule infractions that are uncovered during a hearing.
9. The Judiciary must meet at least once per term for a self-evaluation and discussion of any necessary changes to these
rules and the procedures herein.
10. The Judiciary may not assign cruel or unusual punishments.
11. Judiciary members are expected to attend every meeting. A member is allowed one unexcused absence before
being removed from the panel. A member is allowed four excused absences. At the fourth absence, if the absences
are deemed disruptive to the panel’s functioning, the Head of Judiciary will conduct a vote regarding the removal of
the member. In the case of any vacancy, a special election must be held as outlined in Article VII.
12. All Judiciary members must abide by these rules and procedures or be removed from the Judiciary.
Article VI – Measures Governing Behavior
The price of freedom is responsibility embodied by self-restraint and obligation. Regulations are put forth by the
Administration, the Faculty, and the Students to maintain the community’s values and the balance of freedom and
responsibility. The specific regulations can be found in the Reed-N-Heed.
I. Administrative Policies
Administrative policies are limited to issues deemed particularly significant by the Director. They are related to the
advancement of the school’s mission and the protection of the school’s good name. The development of these policies is
the responsibility of the Director alone.
II. Faculty Policies
Faculty policies are the rules and policies deemed to be significant by the Faculty. In general, they are concerned with
the school’s operation and the safety and well being of the student body. While the Faculty has the final say in the
development of Faculty Policy, students have the right to propose any revisions they see fit. Any Faculty member may
propose an amendment to the Faculty Policy. The proposed alteration is taken to the Faculty to be voted on. The
Administration may veto a proposed policy.
Note to Sections I and II:
The Administration and Faculty pledge to hear student opinion relating to the formulation of policies
that concern students, but they reserve the right to make decisions independent of the majority
opinion of students. While the Administration and Faculty are obligated to explain to the students the
reasoning behind actions taken, students’ opinions do not affect a policy’s introduction into the
Read-N-Heed.
III. Student Standards
In keeping with a commitment to the widest possible student participation in government, the Faculty shall designate
realms of the school-community in which students shall be free to govern as described in the Read-N-Heed. Such areas are
intended to develop in students a sense of duty in the exercise of freedom. The designation of Student Standards assumes
close cooperation between Faculty and Students. Students should only petition the Faculty for such designation after sufficient
prior cooperative thinking and planning by representatives of the Faculty and Council. Both Faculty and Students are
responsible for creating a favorable and supportive atmosphere when Students petition to claim a standard. The Faculty shall
refrain from transferring a Faculty Policy to Students unless there is evidence of widespread desire on the part of Students to
undertake responsible management of that area. There should be ongoing discussion between Faculty and Students regarding
the management of an assumed Standard. Faculty may not mandate changes in Standards or in Student enforcement
procedures of the Standards. It is the Faculty’s duty to re-assume control of a Student Standard if students fail to show
responsibility in their governance of that area. In withdrawing a designation of a Student Standard, the Faculty will give its
reasons first to the Council, and then to the Town Meeting, but there is no implication of a right to veto by either group.
The preferred means of enforcement of all Student Standards is persuasion, which if ineffective, may be followed by
a Record as outlined in Article V.
Student Standards are formulated by the following procedure:
Students should initiate an inquiry into the possibility of assuming responsibility for an area, or Faculty may encourage
students to assume responsibility for an area. Any student, in consultation with any member of the school-community they
choose, writes a proposal for standards or revisions to be implemented in the area in question. Faculty may also propose
changes to existing standards. There will be small group discussions of the proposed standards and means of enforcement.
The final proposal is then submitted to and reviewed by the Council. The Council will then hold a vote. If the proposed
revision passes the Council, the revisions will then be voted on in a Faculty meeting. Representatives from the Council should
attend the Faculty meeting in order to maintain thorough communication. If it passes the Faculty, the proposed Standards
must be presented in a Town Meeting and voted on for final approval. For the amendment to pass the Council, Faculty, and
Town Meeting, the revisions must have a two-thirds majority support of each. If the consultation procedure does not produce
widespread commitment to the proposal on the part of students, the Mayor will remand the matter to the originating group for
further consideration.
At the beginning of the school year, the Council should review existing standards and present them to the Town
Meeting (or to small groups) for consideration and possible revision. Standards of the preceding year are in effect until this
is done.
Article VII – Elections
In order for a democracy to survive, it must be self-perpetuating through the orderly and fair transition of power by
means of open elections.
1. Elections for the Council and the Judiciary will be held biannually near the end of each semester.
2. Only students are allowed to vote in elections. Every student, regardless of circumstance, is allowed and encouraged
to vote.
3. The Faculty has no input in who is allowed to run. Any student may run for a position regardless of circumstance.
4. In order to run for a public office, students must petition. The Council will specify and publicize the nature of the
petition for each office. Petitions for Mayor and Commissions must include platforms and signatures as defined
in Article IV and the Council is responsible for making all platforms public.
5. While students may run for only one office in the Council, they are permitted to run for the Judiciary in addition to an
office in the Council.
6. Each candidate is entrusted with using their best judgment in carrying out a campaign, should they choose to have
one. All campaign material must be appropriate and aimed at positively portraying a candidate rather than negatively
portraying a competitor. The Council may vote to disqualify a candidate who has deviated from these requirements.
7. A special Town Meeting will be held prior to each election day in which candidates may make speeches presenting their
platforms. The Council will administer this Town Meeting and make public the agenda thereof before the meeting.
8. Voting will be by secret ballot after the special Town Meeting. The Council must determine the optimal method to
conduct a fair and impartial voting process, which should be made public before voting commences. The Council
may appoint other students and Faculty members to assist them.
9. The Council will tally the votes and may appoint other students and Faculty members to assist them. The numerical
statistics are to be kept completely confidential, with only the results of the election posted and not the number of
votes each candidate received.
10. Election is by an Alternative Vote. Voters will be given the option to rank the candidates in order of First Choice,
Second Choice, etc. If the candidate with the highest number of First Choice votes obtains a majority, they win the
election. If said candidate does not receive a majority of all votes cast, the candidate with the lowest number of
First Option votes will drop out and their votes will transfer to each respective voter’s Second Choice. This process
will repeat automatically until there is a clear majority winner.
11. If less than three-quarters of the student body participates in the election, there will be a re-election. Elections for
the Commission of Boarding will require three-quarters participation from the boarding student community.
12. No candidate for an election may assist in the election process. Therefore, Council members who plan to run in the
election may neither participate in decisions that the Council makes concerning the election nor assist in
administering the voting or counting.
13. The Council must choose the members who are primarily responsible for conducting the election process. Usually,
this duty is allotted to either the Commission of Citizenship or the Commission of Protection. However, if students
holding both Commissions plan to run for office, the Council must elect two impartial council members to run the
election.
14. In the case of a vacancy in the offices of the Mayor or the Commissions, the Town Meeting must decide by a two
thirds majority vote whether or not the vacancy should be filled. In the case of a vacancy in the offices of the
Class Representatives, the relevant Class Meeting will decide by a two-thirds majority vote whether or not the
vacancy should be filled. If it is decided that a vacancy should be filled, the normal election procedure will take
place. If a vacancy should arise in the Judiciary, the vacancy must be filled by a special election.
Article VIII – Impeachment of Elected Officials
Any member of the Indian Springs school-community can suggest the impeachment of an elected student official.
There are separate processes for the impeachment and removal of students from various offices.
I. Students holding the offices of the Council may be accused and impeached by the following process:
1. The accuser must present the proposal of impeachment to the Judiciary, either in person or in writing, giving specific
reasons for impeachment. The accuser has the option to remain anonymous.
2. The Judiciary will install the Student Recorder as the Impeachment Recorder to record the arguments and proceedings
of the impeachment trial. If the Student Recorder is unable to be impartial, another member of the Judiciary may be
elected by majority vote to be the Impeachment Recorder.
3. The Judiciary can decide on the manner in which to conduct the trial but must hear both the accuser’s and the
accused’s arguments. Based on the trial, the Judiciary will decide by majority vote whether or not the
proposed impeachment should continue to the Town Meeting or the Class Meeting.
4. If the Judiciary decides to advance the impeachment case of a Class Representative, then the case will go to the
respective Class Meeting. Cases for all other Council offices will advance to the Town Meeting. The proceedings in
the preliminary stages (outlined in a, b, and c) are to remain completely confidential even after the Town Meeting
or the Class Meeting, if one is held. Only the information and arguments that the Judiciary deems important
enough for the Impeachment Recorder to present in public meetings may be disclosed, in the case of a Town
Meeting or Class Meeting. Only the Impeachment Recorder may present such information.
5. The Impeachment Recorder must make a presentation to the Town Meeting if the accused is a Mayor or
Commissioner, or to the Class Meeting if the accused is a Class Representative. This presentation should include the
accusations against the official and the accused official’s defense in an equal and unbiased manner. Students in the
Town Meeting or Class Meeting will then vote by secret ballot on whether or not to remove the impeached official
from office. If the impeachment passes the Town Meeting or Class Meeting by a two-thirds majority, the official will
be removed from office immediately.
6. The vacancy procedure outlined in Article VII will determine whether or not a special election will be held.
II. Students holding chairs on the Judiciary may be accused and impeached by the following process:
1. The accuser must present the proposal of impeachment to the Council, either in person or in writing, giving specific
reasons for impeachment. The accuser has the option to remain anonymous.
2. The Council must elect by majority vote an impartial member of the Council to be the Impeachment Recorder to record
the arguments and proceedings of the impeachment trial.
3. The Council can decide on the manner in which to conduct the trial but must hear both the accuser’s and the accused’s
arguments. Based on the trial, the Council will decide by a two-thirds majority vote whether or not the proposed
impeachment should continue to the Town Meeting.
4. The proceedings in the preliminary stages (outlined in a, b, and c) are to remain completely confidential even after the
Town Meeting, if one is held. Only the information and arguments that the Council deems important enough for the
Impeachment Recorder to present in a public meeting may be disclosed, in the case of a Town Meeting. Only the
Impeachment Recorder may present such information.
5. The Impeachment Recorder must present the accusations against the official and the defenses of the accused to the
Town Meeting in an equal and unbiased manner. Students will then vote by secret ballot on whether or not to
remove the impeached official from office. If the impeachment passes the Town Meeting by a two-thirds majority,
the official will be removed from office immediately.
6. In the case that a Judiciary member is impeached, there must be a special election to fill the vacancy.
Article IX – Amendments
Provided that every member of the school-community has the power and obligation to improve it through constructive
change, any person may submit a proposal to amend the Constitution at any time during the academic year. The proposed
amendment must first be submitted to and reviewed by the Council. The Council will hold a vote. If the proposed
amendment passes the Council, the revisions will then go to a Faculty meeting to be voted on. Representatives from the
Council should attend the Faculty meeting in order to maintain thorough communication. If it passes the Faculty, the
revisions must be presented in a Town Meeting and voted on for final approval. For the amendment to pass the Council,
Faculty, and Town
Meeting, the revisions must have two-thirds majority support of each. If at any point significant revisions are made to
an amendment, the process will begin again with the Council’s review.
The Indian Springs School Constitution
Preamble
Under the freedom granted the faculty and students of Indian Springs School by the Board of Governors of the
Alabama Educational Foundation, the governing body of Indian Springs School, there is herewith created the official Indian
Springs School Constitution.
The purpose of the Indian Springs School Constitution and Government is to promote living and learning in accordance
with humane and democratic values and principles, thereby contributing to the intellectual, physical, emotional, spiritual, and
ethical development of all members of the Indian Springs school-community.
In establishing this Constitution, the members of the Indian Springs school-community affirm that students and teachers
do not have to accept themselves or their surroundings as they are but that it is within their power to improve both through
participation in constructive change. Such participation enhances the worth and dignity of humankind, develops responsibility,
and leads persons to the realization of latent powers.
Article I – School-Community Life
The school-community exists for the purpose of providing an environment in which each individual can develop to his
or her full stature.
I. Rights
Each individual has certain rights that are equal for each person. Individuals are guaranteed maximum freedom so long
as they do not infringe upon the rights of others or threaten the general welfare of the school-community.
This Constitution guarantees:
1. The right to freedom of religion, speech, inquiry, and criticism.
2. The right of students to select representatives in the government.
3. The right of students to run for public office.
4. The right to petition the Council or Faculty.
5. The right to assemble peacefully.
6. The right to be considered innocent until proven guilty.
II. Values and Ideals
Certain values and ideals are prized because they contribute to making the school-community a better place in which to
live and learn. Each individual is responsible for working toward the realization of these values and ideals.
In our school-community, we aspire to:
1. Show respect towards the opinions and beliefs of others.
2. Develop genuine friendships.
3. Respect the worth and dignity of the individual.
4. Widen the area of common agreement by which decisions are made and actions taken.
5. Develop personal integrity and moral courage.
6. Help individuals to develop their talents and skills.
7. Stimulate individuals to give direct, unselfish service to the school-community.
8. Reflect disapproval of behavior wherein one individual does or says things harmful to another or to the good name of
the school.
9. Prohibit any organized group that divides or tends to divide the school-community.
We encourage individuals to:
1. Accept their political responsibilities.
2. Keep informed about school-community jobs because the general welfare requires it.
3. Voice opinions and demands directly to the proper officials.
4. Use democratic methods to achieve group agreement.
5. Consider the common good before group or personal liberties.
6. Live in accordance with agreed-upon standards.
7. Evaluate the school-community continuously in an effort to improve it.
Article II – Structure of the Government
The divisions of government are:
1. The Director of Indian Springs School, who is appointed by the Board of Governors.
2. The Administration.
3. The Faculty.
4. The Student Government:
a. Town Meeting: a legislative body comprised of all students that, second to the Administration and Faculty, is the
authority of government at Indian Springs.
b. Council: an executive body comprised of the Mayor, the Commissions, and the Class Representatives. c.
Judiciary: a judicial body comprised of students who hear and rule on infractions of policies, rules, and standards.
Article III – Town Meeting
The heart of the Government at Indian Springs School is the Town Meeting. Town Meeting is open to all citizens and
has three main functions:
1. The Town Meeting serves as the legislative branch of Government and is the final authority on all issues in which the
Faculty is neutral. While the Town Meeting is open to all citizens, only students are allowed to vote. Three-quarters
of the student body constitutes a quorum. Decisions will be made by at least a two-thirds majority vote. The
presiding officer will determine whether the voting will be secret or public.
2. The Town Meeting serves as an open forum in which students can freely voice their concerns and opinions about
pressing issues in an effort to improve the overall quality of life in the school-community.
3. The Town Meeting is a means of communication among all citizens of the school-community. Because a democracy
cannot survive unless its citizens remain consistently informed, weekly meetings are encouraged; however, the
frequency of meetings is determined by need.
Town Meetings are called either by the Mayor with the consent of the Faculty or by the Faculty. Students have the right to
request to have a Town Meeting either through the Council, Faculty, or Director. The Mayor has the right to call a
students-only Town Meeting.
The presiding officer of the Town Meeting is the Mayor. In the absence of the Mayor, the Council will designate a presiding
officer. However, if the Town Meeting is called by the Faculty, the Director or someone designated by the Faculty may take
charge of the meeting.
Article IV – The Council
The Council is a body of students elected entirely by the students for the purpose of providing leadership in the
community. The most important responsibility of the Council is to assess the quality of school-community life and improve it
on as many levels as possible.
I. The offices of the Council are:
1. The Mayor, whose duty is to provide leadership for the Council and the community as a whole in building a greater
understanding of the aims and purposes of the community and to bring about the realization of these aims and
purposes through the various Council offices. The Mayor is responsible for seeing that each Council office fulfills
its respective duties and platforms and for coordinating the work of the Council.
2. Commission of Citizenship, whose duties are concerned with the continuing evaluation of the quality of citizenship as
exhibited on a day-to-day basis, in and out of the classroom, and in the larger community beyond the boundaries
of Indian Springs School. Specific examples can include, but are not limited to, organizing Development Day,
promoting service opportunities, and overseeing student clubs.
3. Commission of Education, whose duties are concerned with the continuing evaluation and improvement of teaching
and learning and of the conditions that influence the academic experience. Specific examples can include, but are
not limited to, managing the Writing Center, creating a student tutor system, and participating in Academics
Committee meetings.
4. Commission of Protection, whose duties are concerned with the enforcement of the standards of the school-community
and the promotion of environmental protection. Specific examples can include, but are not limited to, reporting
attendance at mandatory meetings and issuing Records for unexcused absences at such meetings, organizing and
carrying out campus recycling, and discouraging littering, and managing matters surrounding the American flag(s)
flown on campus. Members of the commission are, in a special sense, guardians of the rights, values, principles, and
ideals set out in this Constitution. The preferred method of enforcement of such standards is persuasion. However,
where persuasion does not prove successful, the commission may take more stringent measures.
5. Commission of Recreation, whose duties are concerned with the continuing evaluation and improvement of wholesome
recreational activities in the school-community. Specific examples can include, but are not limited to, organizing
school dances, planning Winter Formal, and leading activities that promote school spirit.
6. Commission of Services, whose duties are concerned with the continuing evaluation and improvement of the range of
needed services in the school-community. The most evident example of this duty is the operation of the student
store.
7. Commission of Boarding, whose duties are concerned with the continuing evaluation and improvement of dormitory
life, which involves the facilitation and execution of dormitory administration such as maintenance and rule
enforcement. The Commission is to be elected from and by the boarding student community as outlined in Article VII.
8. Deputies, who are students installed by a specific Commission to aid in the execution of its duties and to expand
community participation in Government. Each Commission may have up to three Deputies, with the exception of
Commissioners of Boarding, who may have up to two deputies in each dormitory. No one in any of the Council
offices may become a Deputy, and Deputies may serve only one Commission. Deputies are nominated by the
Commission and must be approved individually by the Council. The Commission or the Council may remove a Deputy
at any time; when a Commission leaves office, the Deputies of that Commission also leave their posts. Deputies do
not have a vote in the Council but are strongly encouraged to attend Council meetings.
9. Class Representatives, whose duties are concerned with the continuing evaluation of opinions and desires of their
respective classes. Class Representatives are responsible for organizing and voicing class concerns to the Council
and for taking attendance for their respective grades at mandatory meetings. Each class will elect one or two
representatives from its own class and for its own class.
10. The Council Secretary, whose duties are concerned with the documentation and communication of recent plans,
updates, and discussions mentioned during Student Government and Town Meetings and contributing to task
management within the Council. Specific examples can include, but are not limited to, taking notes during Council
meetings, taking notes during Town Meetings, and assisting the Mayor in certain projects. These notes must be
reviewed and approved by the Council before their release. The Council Secretary does not have a vote in the
Council. The Council Secretary is nominated by the Mayor and must be approved individually by the Council through a
⅔majority vote.
II. Additional responsibilities of the Council:
1. Each office of the Council must prepare a written platform, a program of action to be implemented during the specified
term of office. This platform should present the goals and methodology for the office.
2. The Council should hold regular meetings to discuss and evaluate ongoing programs. The meetings are compulsory for
all members unless a viable excuse is given. Embracing the principles of democracy, all members of the school
community are encouraged to attend Council meetings.
3. The Council must, at times, make decisions on items such as those called for in this Constitution. In order to make
these decisions, the Council must vote. Three-quarters of the Council constitutes a quorum, and decisions will be
made by a two-thirds majority vote.
4. The Council must administer elections at the end of each semester, as outlined in Article VII.
5. The Mayor has final responsibility for the effectiveness of the Council, and the Director of Indian Springs School has
final responsibility for the effectiveness of the Faculty Liaisons, which are mentor Faculty members assigned to
each Commission and Class. It is the duty of the Mayor and Director to see that the Commissions and Liaisons
develop a unified program in order to improve specific aspects of the school-community from the vantage point of
a comprehensive view of school-community problems.
Article V – The Judiciary
The Indian Springs School Judiciary is a panel elected entirely by the students for the purpose of hearing and ruling on
infractions of policies, rules, and standards within the school-community. The Judiciary is composed of eleven students and
one Faculty Liaison. The eleven-member panel must be composed of one 8th (for the second semester only), one 9th, one
10th, one 11th, and one 12th grader as well as two boarding students, elected by popular vote by the entire student body.
Once these stipulations have been met, the remaining spots will be filled by those receiving the highest number of votes. Any
student who wishes to run for the Judiciary is both welcome and encouraged to do so. The Faculty has no input regarding
who is allowed to run.
I. Offices of Judiciary
There are two offices of Judiciary: the Head of Judiciary and the Student Recorder. Both positions are elected at the first
Judiciary meeting following general elections by a combined panel of incoming and outgoing members of the Judiciary. Voting
is anonymous, and offices are decided by majority vote.
1. The Head of Judiciary is the leader of the panel and serves as a guide and moderator during discussions rather than a
member advocating their own opinions. The Head of Judiciary has no vote during regular meetings except in the case of a tie,
where they serve as a tiebreaker. In order to run for Head of Judiciary, a student must have previously served at least one
term on the panel, if there is such a person. The Head of Judiciary is responsible for organizing meeting times, bringing a
copy of the Read ‘n’ Heed, Records, and precedents to every meeting, taking attendance at meetings, and notifying the
accused of the accused offense as well as the date, time, and location of the hearing. After each hearing, it is the Head’s
responsibility to provide the Dean of Student Life with a report of all cases, rulings, and work hours or other punishments
given.
2. The Student Recorder keeps an accurate record of the decisions made by the Judiciary and serves as the
Impeachment Recorder during the impeachment of a Council member as outlined in Article VIII. In the event of the Head of
Judiciary receiving a Record, the Student Recorder assumes the role of Head of Judiciary for that case.
II. The Faculty Liaison
The Faculty Liaison to the Judiciary is the Faculty’s representation on the panel. They serve only as a guide; students
maintain the primary responsibility and control of the Judiciary. The Faculty Liaison may voice an opinion, act as a clarifier
and interpreter of the rules, and assist in interrogating the accused. They may not vote during regular meetings or during
the election of offices. The Faculty Liaison is responsible for creating a written memo of all proceedings of the Judiciary to
distribute to the Director, the Dean of Academics, the Dean of Student Life, and the Dean of Residential Life. The Faculty
Liaison is expected to abide by all policies, rules, and procedures of the Judiciary.
III. The Dean of Student Life
The Dean of Student Life is not a member of the Judiciary and is not present during meetings; they serve as an outside
assistant in executing the administrative duties of the Judiciary. After each meeting, an outline of all decisions, including a
breakdown of the work hours and/or other punishments and their corresponding offenses, is given to the Dean of Student
Life by the Head of Judiciary. The Dean of Student Life is responsible for notifying each student and their Faculty Advisor of
the work hour assignment and/or other punishment given by the Judiciary. It is the Dean of Student Life’s responsibility to
keep track of work hours performed and time frames for other punishments for each student. When a Faculty member
submits a record, they are to be informed of the case’s outcome by the Dean of Student Life.
IV. Judiciary Procedure
Persuasion is the primary means of enforcement of the rules in the school-community. However, acknowledging that a
warning may not alter behavior in all situations, a Record may be issued after persuasion has been attempted. Any member of
the community may write a Record to report a rule infraction. Records are submitted to the Head of Judiciary through email.
In the Record, the accuser should provide a detailed written explanation of the situation along with any other relevant
information. If there is not enough information from the accuser to prove guilt, the accused should be deemed innocent. Prior
to the
hearing, the Head of Judiciary may ask the accuser if there is more information associated with the record. The responsibility
for providing details falls on the accuser in order for the Judiciary to remain the jury rather than the prosecutor. The accuser
may choose to remain anonymous during the proceedings of the hearing. The accuser should provide all relevant information
in the original record, but may request to attend the hearing if he or she would like to provide additional information. When a
Record is submitted, the Head will alert the Judiciary, the accused, and the accuser (when necessary) of the date, time, and
location of the hearing. Meetings should be called as regularly as possible. Six members of the Judiciary other than the Head
must be present to constitute a quorum.
The accused must appear before the Judiciary on the specified day. If the accused does not do so and does not provide a
viable excuse, they will automatically be given a set punishment. On the day of the hearing, the Head will read the Record
aloud and explain the case to the Judiciary. The Judiciary will then summon and question the accused concerning all aspects
of the case and any connected incidents. Upon completion, the accused will leave the room. Only the eleven members of the
Judiciary and the Faculty Liaison are allowed to be present during deliberation. The panel must first determine if the accused is
innocent or guilty. The accused is considered innocent until proven guilty. If the accused is deemed guilty, the precedent
system—a written record of past rule infractions and their correlating punishments—will be used as a guide during the
deliberation of punishment. However, due to the uniqueness of each case, the precedent system should not necessarily be
followed. Finally, the Judiciary will set a punishment by majority vote. If at any point during the process the Judiciary
determines it has inadequate information, the panel reserves the right to postpone a case until more information has been
gathered from relevant parties. The accused may also be summoned for additional questioning for clarification.
On the following school day, the accused must report to the Dean of Student Life to receive their punishment. If work
hours were assigned, the accused must then contact the appropriate adult to establish a schedule for the completion of the
work hours. If the work hours are not completed within the set time period, the accused will be charged with “work hour
delinquency,” and the uncompleted number of hours shall be doubled automatically. If the accused vehemently maintains their
innocence yet is given work hours, they have the right to formally submit an appeal by email to the Judiciary. After the Dean
of Student Life and the Director are notified of the petition, the Judiciary will hold another hearing to reexamine evidence and
question relevant parties.
Strict confidentiality must be maintained throughout the entire Judiciary process.
V. Judiciary Rules
1. All Judiciary members and the Faculty Liaison must act with seriousness of purpose, maintain respectful conduct, and
lead by example. This is of the utmost importance to the effectiveness of the Judiciary, which must maintain the
respect of the community to function properly.
2. All Judiciary members have equal say and power regardless of age or experience.
3. Those hearing the case and receiving summary memos must maintain the confidentiality of all proceedings and
outcomes. There will be no discussion of the decision-making process in front of the accused. Only the accused has
the right to discuss the Judiciary’s decision; it is that person’s decision alone to discuss their case.
4. If a Judiciary member is responsible for issuing a record, that member will not vote on that case or be present for its
deliberation.
5. If a Judiciary member receives a Record, that member may not be present during the deliberation of the case.
6. Personal bias of any kind against anyone may not affect the vote or discussion of a case. If a panel member feels
unable to ignore a bias, they should recuse themselves from the case.
7. If the accused is found guilty of breaking a rule, even if members of the Judiciary disagree with the rule, the Judiciary
must punish it accordingly.
8. The Judiciary is responsible for punishing any rule infractions that are uncovered during a hearing.
9. The Judiciary must meet at least once per term for a self-evaluation and discussion of any necessary changes to these
rules and the procedures herein.
10. The Judiciary may not assign cruel or unusual punishments.
11. Judiciary members are expected to attend every meeting. A member is allowed one unexcused absence before
being removed from the panel. A member is allowed four excused absences. At the fourth absence, if the absences
are deemed disruptive to the panel’s functioning, the Head of Judiciary will conduct a vote regarding the removal of
the member. In the case of any vacancy, a special election must be held as outlined in Article VII.
12. All Judiciary members must abide by these rules and procedures or be removed from the Judiciary.
Article VI – Measures Governing Behavior
The price of freedom is responsibility embodied by self-restraint and obligation. Regulations are put forth by the
Administration, the Faculty, and the Students to maintain the community’s values and the balance of freedom and
responsibility. The specific regulations can be found in the Reed-N-Heed.
I. Administrative Policies
Administrative policies are limited to issues deemed particularly significant by the Director. They are related to the
advancement of the school’s mission and the protection of the school’s good name. The development of these policies is
the responsibility of the Director alone.
II. Faculty Policies
Faculty policies are the rules and policies deemed to be significant by the Faculty. In general, they are concerned with
the school’s operation and the safety and well being of the student body. While the Faculty has the final say in the
development of Faculty Policy, students have the right to propose any revisions they see fit. Any Faculty member may
propose an amendment to the Faculty Policy. The proposed alteration is taken to the Faculty to be voted on. The
Administration may veto a proposed policy.
Note to Sections I and II:
The Administration and Faculty pledge to hear student opinion relating to the formulation of policies
that concern students, but they reserve the right to make decisions independent of the majority
opinion of students. While the Administration and Faculty are obligated to explain to the students the
reasoning behind actions taken, students’ opinions do not affect a policy’s introduction into the
Read-N-Heed.
III. Student Standards
In keeping with a commitment to the widest possible student participation in government, the Faculty shall designate
realms of the school-community in which students shall be free to govern as described in the Read-N-Heed. Such areas are
intended to develop in students a sense of duty in the exercise of freedom. The designation of Student Standards assumes
close cooperation between Faculty and Students. Students should only petition the Faculty for such designation after sufficient
prior cooperative thinking and planning by representatives of the Faculty and Council. Both Faculty and Students are
responsible for creating a favorable and supportive atmosphere when Students petition to claim a standard. The Faculty shall
refrain from transferring a Faculty Policy to Students unless there is evidence of widespread desire on the part of Students to
undertake responsible management of that area. There should be ongoing discussion between Faculty and Students regarding
the management of an assumed Standard. Faculty may not mandate changes in Standards or in Student enforcement
procedures of the Standards. It is the Faculty’s duty to re-assume control of a Student Standard if students fail to show
responsibility in their governance of that area. In withdrawing a designation of a Student Standard, the Faculty will give its
reasons first to the Council, and then to the Town Meeting, but there is no implication of a right to veto by either group.
The preferred means of enforcement of all Student Standards is persuasion, which if ineffective, may be followed by
a Record as outlined in Article V.
Student Standards are formulated by the following procedure:
Students should initiate an inquiry into the possibility of assuming responsibility for an area, or Faculty may encourage
students to assume responsibility for an area. Any student, in consultation with any member of the school-community they
choose, writes a proposal for standards or revisions to be implemented in the area in question. Faculty may also propose
changes to existing standards. There will be small group discussions of the proposed standards and means of enforcement.
The final proposal is then submitted to and reviewed by the Council. The Council will then hold a vote. If the proposed
revision passes the Council, the revisions will then be voted on in a Faculty meeting. Representatives from the Council should
attend the Faculty meeting in order to maintain thorough communication. If it passes the Faculty, the proposed Standards
must be presented in a Town Meeting and voted on for final approval. For the amendment to pass the Council, Faculty, and
Town Meeting, the revisions must have a two-thirds majority support of each. If the consultation procedure does not produce
widespread commitment to the proposal on the part of students, the Mayor will remand the matter to the originating group for
further consideration.
At the beginning of the school year, the Council should review existing standards and present them to the Town
Meeting (or to small groups) for consideration and possible revision. Standards of the preceding year are in effect until this
is done.
Article VII – Elections
In order for a democracy to survive, it must be self-perpetuating through the orderly and fair transition of power by
means of open elections.
1. Elections for the Council and the Judiciary will be held biannually near the end of each semester.
2. Only students are allowed to vote in elections. Every student, regardless of circumstance, is allowed and encouraged
to vote.
3. The Faculty has no input in who is allowed to run. Any student may run for a position regardless of circumstance.
4. In order to run for a public office, students must petition. The Council will specify and publicize the nature of the
petition for each office. Petitions for Mayor and Commissions must include platforms and signatures as defined
in Article IV and the Council is responsible for making all platforms public.
5. While students may run for only one office in the Council, they are permitted to run for the Judiciary in addition to an
office in the Council.
6. Each candidate is entrusted with using their best judgment in carrying out a campaign, should they choose to have
one. All campaign material must be appropriate and aimed at positively portraying a candidate rather than negatively
portraying a competitor. The Council may vote to disqualify a candidate who has deviated from these requirements.
7. A special Town Meeting will be held prior to each election day in which candidates may make speeches presenting their
platforms. The Council will administer this Town Meeting and make public the agenda thereof before the meeting.
8. Voting will be by secret ballot after the special Town Meeting. The Council must determine the optimal method to
conduct a fair and impartial voting process, which should be made public before voting commences. The Council
may appoint other students and Faculty members to assist them.
9. The Council will tally the votes and may appoint other students and Faculty members to assist them. The numerical
statistics are to be kept completely confidential, with only the results of the election posted and not the number of
votes each candidate received.
10. Election is by an Alternative Vote. Voters will be given the option to rank the candidates in order of First Choice,
Second Choice, etc. If the candidate with the highest number of First Choice votes obtains a majority, they win the
election. If said candidate does not receive a majority of all votes cast, the candidate with the lowest number of
First Option votes will drop out and their votes will transfer to each respective voter’s Second Choice. This process
will repeat automatically until there is a clear majority winner.
11. If less than three-quarters of the student body participates in the election, there will be a re-election. Elections for
the Commission of Boarding will require three-quarters participation from the boarding student community.
12. No candidate for an election may assist in the election process. Therefore, Council members who plan to run in the
election may neither participate in decisions that the Council makes concerning the election nor assist in
administering the voting or counting.
13. The Council must choose the members who are primarily responsible for conducting the election process. Usually,
this duty is allotted to either the Commission of Citizenship or the Commission of Protection. However, if students
holding both Commissions plan to run for office, the Council must elect two impartial council members to run the
election.
14. In the case of a vacancy in the offices of the Mayor or the Commissions, the Town Meeting must decide by a two
thirds majority vote whether or not the vacancy should be filled. In the case of a vacancy in the offices of the
Class Representatives, the relevant Class Meeting will decide by a two-thirds majority vote whether or not the
vacancy should be filled. If it is decided that a vacancy should be filled, the normal election procedure will take
place. If a vacancy should arise in the Judiciary, the vacancy must be filled by a special election.
Article VIII – Impeachment of Elected Officials
Any member of the Indian Springs school-community can suggest the impeachment of an elected student official.
There are separate processes for the impeachment and removal of students from various offices.
I. Students holding the offices of the Council may be accused and impeached by the following process:
1. The accuser must present the proposal of impeachment to the Judiciary, either in person or in writing, giving specific
reasons for impeachment. The accuser has the option to remain anonymous.
2. The Judiciary will install the Student Recorder as the Impeachment Recorder to record the arguments and proceedings
of the impeachment trial. If the Student Recorder is unable to be impartial, another member of the Judiciary may be
elected by majority vote to be the Impeachment Recorder.
3. The Judiciary can decide on the manner in which to conduct the trial but must hear both the accuser’s and the
accused’s arguments. Based on the trial, the Judiciary will decide by majority vote whether or not the
proposed impeachment should continue to the Town Meeting or the Class Meeting.
4. If the Judiciary decides to advance the impeachment case of a Class Representative, then the case will go to the
respective Class Meeting. Cases for all other Council offices will advance to the Town Meeting. The proceedings in
the preliminary stages (outlined in a, b, and c) are to remain completely confidential even after the Town Meeting
or the Class Meeting, if one is held. Only the information and arguments that the Judiciary deems important
enough for the Impeachment Recorder to present in public meetings may be disclosed, in the case of a Town
Meeting or Class Meeting. Only the Impeachment Recorder may present such information.
5. The Impeachment Recorder must make a presentation to the Town Meeting if the accused is a Mayor or
Commissioner, or to the Class Meeting if the accused is a Class Representative. This presentation should include the
accusations against the official and the accused official’s defense in an equal and unbiased manner. Students in the
Town Meeting or Class Meeting will then vote by secret ballot on whether or not to remove the impeached official
from office. If the impeachment passes the Town Meeting or Class Meeting by a two-thirds majority, the official will
be removed from office immediately.
6. The vacancy procedure outlined in Article VII will determine whether or not a special election will be held.
II. Students holding chairs on the Judiciary may be accused and impeached by the following process:
1. The accuser must present the proposal of impeachment to the Council, either in person or in writing, giving specific
reasons for impeachment. The accuser has the option to remain anonymous.
2. The Council must elect by majority vote an impartial member of the Council to be the Impeachment Recorder to record
the arguments and proceedings of the impeachment trial.
3. The Council can decide on the manner in which to conduct the trial but must hear both the accuser’s and the accused’s
arguments. Based on the trial, the Council will decide by a two-thirds majority vote whether or not the proposed
impeachment should continue to the Town Meeting.
4. The proceedings in the preliminary stages (outlined in a, b, and c) are to remain completely confidential even after the
Town Meeting, if one is held. Only the information and arguments that the Council deems important enough for the
Impeachment Recorder to present in a public meeting may be disclosed, in the case of a Town Meeting. Only the
Impeachment Recorder may present such information.
5. The Impeachment Recorder must present the accusations against the official and the defenses of the accused to the
Town Meeting in an equal and unbiased manner. Students will then vote by secret ballot on whether or not to
remove the impeached official from office. If the impeachment passes the Town Meeting by a two-thirds majority,
the official will be removed from office immediately.
6. In the case that a Judiciary member is impeached, there must be a special election to fill the vacancy.
Article IX – Amendments
Provided that every member of the school-community has the power and obligation to improve it through constructive
change, any person may submit a proposal to amend the Constitution at any time during the academic year. The proposed
amendment must first be submitted to and reviewed by the Council. The Council will hold a vote. If the proposed
amendment passes the Council, the revisions will then go to a Faculty meeting to be voted on. Representatives from the
Council should attend the Faculty meeting in order to maintain thorough communication. If it passes the Faculty, the
revisions must be presented in a Town Meeting and voted on for final approval. For the amendment to pass the Council,
Faculty, and Town
Meeting, the revisions must have two-thirds majority support of each. If at any point significant revisions are made to
an amendment, the process will begin again with the Council’s review.
The Indian Springs School Constitution
Preamble
Under the freedom granted the faculty and students of Indian Springs School by the Board of Governors of the
Alabama Educational Foundation, the governing body of Indian Springs School, there is herewith created the official Indian
Springs School Constitution.
The purpose of the Indian Springs School Constitution and Government is to promote living and learning in accordance
with humane and democratic values and principles, thereby contributing to the intellectual, physical, emotional, spiritual, and
ethical development of all members of the Indian Springs school-community.
In establishing this Constitution, the members of the Indian Springs school-community affirm that students and teachers
do not have to accept themselves or their surroundings as they are but that it is within their power to improve both through
participation in constructive change. Such participation enhances the worth and dignity of humankind, develops responsibility,
and leads persons to the realization of latent powers.
Article I – School-Community Life
The school-community exists for the purpose of providing an environment in which each individual can develop to his
or her full stature.
I. Rights
Each individual has certain rights that are equal for each person. Individuals are guaranteed maximum freedom so long
as they do not infringe upon the rights of others or threaten the general welfare of the school-community.
This Constitution guarantees:
1. The right to freedom of religion, speech, inquiry, and criticism.
2. The right of students to select representatives in the government.
3. The right of students to run for public office.
4. The right to petition the Council or Faculty.
5. The right to assemble peacefully.
6. The right to be considered innocent until proven guilty.
II. Values and Ideals
Certain values and ideals are prized because they contribute to making the school-community a better place in which to
live and learn. Each individual is responsible for working toward the realization of these values and ideals.
In our school-community, we aspire to:
1. Show respect towards the opinions and beliefs of others.
2. Develop genuine friendships.
3. Respect the worth and dignity of the individual.
4. Widen the area of common agreement by which decisions are made and actions taken.
5. Develop personal integrity and moral courage.
6. Help individuals to develop their talents and skills.
7. Stimulate individuals to give direct, unselfish service to the school-community.
8. Reflect disapproval of behavior wherein one individual does or says things harmful to another or to the good name of
the school.
9. Prohibit any organized group that divides or tends to divide the school-community.
We encourage individuals to:
1. Accept their political responsibilities.
2. Keep informed about school-community jobs because the general welfare requires it.
3. Voice opinions and demands directly to the proper officials.
4. Use democratic methods to achieve group agreement.
5. Consider the common good before group or personal liberties.
6. Live in accordance with agreed-upon standards.
7. Evaluate the school-community continuously in an effort to improve it.
Article II – Structure of the Government
The divisions of government are:
1. The Director of Indian Springs School, who is appointed by the Board of Governors.
2. The Administration.
3. The Faculty.
4. The Student Government:
a. Town Meeting: a legislative body comprised of all students that, second to the Administration and Faculty, is the
authority of government at Indian Springs.
b. Council: an executive body comprised of the Mayor, the Commissions, and the Class Representatives. c.
Judiciary: a judicial body comprised of students who hear and rule on infractions of policies, rules, and standards.
Article III – Town Meeting
The heart of the Government at Indian Springs School is the Town Meeting. Town Meeting is open to all citizens and
has three main functions:
1. The Town Meeting serves as the legislative branch of Government and is the final authority on all issues in which the
Faculty is neutral. While the Town Meeting is open to all citizens, only students are allowed to vote. Three-quarters
of the student body constitutes a quorum. Decisions will be made by at least a two-thirds majority vote. The
presiding officer will determine whether the voting will be secret or public.
2. The Town Meeting serves as an open forum in which students can freely voice their concerns and opinions about
pressing issues in an effort to improve the overall quality of life in the school-community.
3. The Town Meeting is a means of communication among all citizens of the school-community. Because a democracy
cannot survive unless its citizens remain consistently informed, weekly meetings are encouraged; however, the
frequency of meetings is determined by need.
Town Meetings are called either by the Mayor with the consent of the Faculty or by the Faculty. Students have the right to
request to have a Town Meeting either through the Council, Faculty, or Director. The Mayor has the right to call a
students-only Town Meeting.
The presiding officer of the Town Meeting is the Mayor. In the absence of the Mayor, the Council will designate a presiding
officer. However, if the Town Meeting is called by the Faculty, the Director or someone designated by the Faculty may take
charge of the meeting.
Article IV – The Council
The Council is a body of students elected entirely by the students for the purpose of providing leadership in the
community. The most important responsibility of the Council is to assess the quality of school-community life and improve it
on as many levels as possible.
I. The offices of the Council are:
1. The Mayor, whose duty is to provide leadership for the Council and the community as a whole in building a greater
understanding of the aims and purposes of the community and to bring about the realization of these aims and
purposes through the various Council offices. The Mayor is responsible for seeing that each Council office fulfills
its respective duties and platforms and for coordinating the work of the Council.
2. Commission of Citizenship, whose duties are concerned with the continuing evaluation of the quality of citizenship as
exhibited on a day-to-day basis, in and out of the classroom, and in the larger community beyond the boundaries
of Indian Springs School. Specific examples can include, but are not limited to, organizing Development Day,
promoting service opportunities, and overseeing student clubs.
3. Commission of Education, whose duties are concerned with the continuing evaluation and improvement of teaching
and learning and of the conditions that influence the academic experience. Specific examples can include, but are
not limited to, managing the Writing Center, creating a student tutor system, and participating in Academics
Committee meetings.
4. Commission of Protection, whose duties are concerned with the enforcement of the standards of the school-community
and the promotion of environmental protection. Specific examples can include, but are not limited to, reporting
attendance at mandatory meetings and issuing Records for unexcused absences at such meetings, organizing and
carrying out campus recycling, and discouraging littering, and managing matters surrounding the American flag(s)
flown on campus. Members of the commission are, in a special sense, guardians of the rights, values, principles, and
ideals set out in this Constitution. The preferred method of enforcement of such standards is persuasion. However,
where persuasion does not prove successful, the commission may take more stringent measures.
5. Commission of Recreation, whose duties are concerned with the continuing evaluation and improvement of wholesome
recreational activities in the school-community. Specific examples can include, but are not limited to, organizing
school dances, planning Winter Formal, and leading activities that promote school spirit.
6. Commission of Services, whose duties are concerned with the continuing evaluation and improvement of the range of
needed services in the school-community. The most evident example of this duty is the operation of the student
store.
7. Commission of Boarding, whose duties are concerned with the continuing evaluation and improvement of dormitory
life, which involves the facilitation and execution of dormitory administration such as maintenance and rule
enforcement. The Commission is to be elected from and by the boarding student community as outlined in Article VII.
8. Deputies, who are students installed by a specific Commission to aid in the execution of its duties and to expand
community participation in Government. Each Commission may have up to three Deputies, with the exception of
Commissioners of Boarding, who may have up to two deputies in each dormitory. No one in any of the Council
offices may become a Deputy, and Deputies may serve only one Commission. Deputies are nominated by the
Commission and must be approved individually by the Council. The Commission or the Council may remove a Deputy
at any time; when a Commission leaves office, the Deputies of that Commission also leave their posts. Deputies do
not have a vote in the Council but are strongly encouraged to attend Council meetings.
9. Class Representatives, whose duties are concerned with the continuing evaluation of opinions and desires of their
respective classes. Class Representatives are responsible for organizing and voicing class concerns to the Council
and for taking attendance for their respective grades at mandatory meetings. Each class will elect one or two
representatives from its own class and for its own class.
10. The Council Secretary, whose duties are concerned with the documentation and communication of recent plans,
updates, and discussions mentioned during Student Government and Town Meetings and contributing to task
management within the Council. Specific examples can include, but are not limited to, taking notes during Council
meetings, taking notes during Town Meetings, and assisting the Mayor in certain projects. These notes must be
reviewed and approved by the Council before their release. The Council Secretary does not have a vote in the
Council. The Council Secretary is nominated by the Mayor and must be approved individually by the Council through a
⅔majority vote.
II. Additional responsibilities of the Council:
1. Each office of the Council must prepare a written platform, a program of action to be implemented during the specified
term of office. This platform should present the goals and methodology for the office.
2. The Council should hold regular meetings to discuss and evaluate ongoing programs. The meetings are compulsory for
all members unless a viable excuse is given. Embracing the principles of democracy, all members of the school
community are encouraged to attend Council meetings.
3. The Council must, at times, make decisions on items such as those called for in this Constitution. In order to make
these decisions, the Council must vote. Three-quarters of the Council constitutes a quorum, and decisions will be
made by a two-thirds majority vote.
4. The Council must administer elections at the end of each semester, as outlined in Article VII.
5. The Mayor has final responsibility for the effectiveness of the Council, and the Director of Indian Springs School has
final responsibility for the effectiveness of the Faculty Liaisons, which are mentor Faculty members assigned to
each Commission and Class. It is the duty of the Mayor and Director to see that the Commissions and Liaisons
develop a unified program in order to improve specific aspects of the school-community from the vantage point of
a comprehensive view of school-community problems.
Article V – The Judiciary
The Indian Springs School Judiciary is a panel elected entirely by the students for the purpose of hearing and ruling on
infractions of policies, rules, and standards within the school-community. The Judiciary is composed of eleven students and
one Faculty Liaison. The eleven-member panel must be composed of one 8th (for the second semester only), one 9th, one
10th, one 11th, and one 12th grader as well as two boarding students, elected by popular vote by the entire student body.
Once these stipulations have been met, the remaining spots will be filled by those receiving the highest number of votes. Any
student who wishes to run for the Judiciary is both welcome and encouraged to do so. The Faculty has no input regarding
who is allowed to run.
I. Offices of Judiciary
There are two offices of Judiciary: the Head of Judiciary and the Student Recorder. Both positions are elected at the first
Judiciary meeting following general elections by a combined panel of incoming and outgoing members of the Judiciary. Voting
is anonymous, and offices are decided by majority vote.
1. The Head of Judiciary is the leader of the panel and serves as a guide and moderator during discussions rather than a
member advocating their own opinions. The Head of Judiciary has no vote during regular meetings except in the case of a tie,
where they serve as a tiebreaker. In order to run for Head of Judiciary, a student must have previously served at least one
term on the panel, if there is such a person. The Head of Judiciary is responsible for organizing meeting times, bringing a
copy of the Read ‘n’ Heed, Records, and precedents to every meeting, taking attendance at meetings, and notifying the
accused of the accused offense as well as the date, time, and location of the hearing. After each hearing, it is the Head’s
responsibility to provide the Dean of Student Life with a report of all cases, rulings, and work hours or other punishments
given.
2. The Student Recorder keeps an accurate record of the decisions made by the Judiciary and serves as the
Impeachment Recorder during the impeachment of a Council member as outlined in Article VIII. In the event of the Head of
Judiciary receiving a Record, the Student Recorder assumes the role of Head of Judiciary for that case.
II. The Faculty Liaison
The Faculty Liaison to the Judiciary is the Faculty’s representation on the panel. They serve only as a guide; students
maintain the primary responsibility and control of the Judiciary. The Faculty Liaison may voice an opinion, act as a clarifier
and interpreter of the rules, and assist in interrogating the accused. They may not vote during regular meetings or during
the election of offices. The Faculty Liaison is responsible for creating a written memo of all proceedings of the Judiciary to
distribute to the Director, the Dean of Academics, the Dean of Student Life, and the Dean of Residential Life. The Faculty
Liaison is expected to abide by all policies, rules, and procedures of the Judiciary.
III. The Dean of Student Life
The Dean of Student Life is not a member of the Judiciary and is not present during meetings; they serve as an outside
assistant in executing the administrative duties of the Judiciary. After each meeting, an outline of all decisions, including a
breakdown of the work hours and/or other punishments and their corresponding offenses, is given to the Dean of Student
Life by the Head of Judiciary. The Dean of Student Life is responsible for notifying each student and their Faculty Advisor of
the work hour assignment and/or other punishment given by the Judiciary. It is the Dean of Student Life’s responsibility to
keep track of work hours performed and time frames for other punishments for each student. When a Faculty member
submits a record, they are to be informed of the case’s outcome by the Dean of Student Life.
IV. Judiciary Procedure
Persuasion is the primary means of enforcement of the rules in the school-community. However, acknowledging that a
warning may not alter behavior in all situations, a Record may be issued after persuasion has been attempted. Any member of
the community may write a Record to report a rule infraction. Records are submitted to the Head of Judiciary through email.
In the Record, the accuser should provide a detailed written explanation of the situation along with any other relevant
information. If there is not enough information from the accuser to prove guilt, the accused should be deemed innocent. Prior
to the
hearing, the Head of Judiciary may ask the accuser if there is more information associated with the record. The responsibility
for providing details falls on the accuser in order for the Judiciary to remain the jury rather than the prosecutor. The accuser
may choose to remain anonymous during the proceedings of the hearing. The accuser should provide all relevant information
in the original record, but may request to attend the hearing if he or she would like to provide additional information. When a
Record is submitted, the Head will alert the Judiciary, the accused, and the accuser (when necessary) of the date, time, and
location of the hearing. Meetings should be called as regularly as possible. Six members of the Judiciary other than the Head
must be present to constitute a quorum.
The accused must appear before the Judiciary on the specified day. If the accused does not do so and does not provide a
viable excuse, they will automatically be given a set punishment. On the day of the hearing, the Head will read the Record
aloud and explain the case to the Judiciary. The Judiciary will then summon and question the accused concerning all aspects
of the case and any connected incidents. Upon completion, the accused will leave the room. Only the eleven members of the
Judiciary and the Faculty Liaison are allowed to be present during deliberation. The panel must first determine if the accused is
innocent or guilty. The accused is considered innocent until proven guilty. If the accused is deemed guilty, the precedent
system—a written record of past rule infractions and their correlating punishments—will be used as a guide during the
deliberation of punishment. However, due to the uniqueness of each case, the precedent system should not necessarily be
followed. Finally, the Judiciary will set a punishment by majority vote. If at any point during the process the Judiciary
determines it has inadequate information, the panel reserves the right to postpone a case until more information has been
gathered from relevant parties. The accused may also be summoned for additional questioning for clarification.
On the following school day, the accused must report to the Dean of Student Life to receive their punishment. If work
hours were assigned, the accused must then contact the appropriate adult to establish a schedule for the completion of the
work hours. If the work hours are not completed within the set time period, the accused will be charged with “work hour
delinquency,” and the uncompleted number of hours shall be doubled automatically. If the accused vehemently maintains their
innocence yet is given work hours, they have the right to formally submit an appeal by email to the Judiciary. After the Dean
of Student Life and the Director are notified of the petition, the Judiciary will hold another hearing to reexamine evidence and
question relevant parties.
Strict confidentiality must be maintained throughout the entire Judiciary process.
V. Judiciary Rules
1. All Judiciary members and the Faculty Liaison must act with seriousness of purpose, maintain respectful conduct, and
lead by example. This is of the utmost importance to the effectiveness of the Judiciary, which must maintain the
respect of the community to function properly.
2. All Judiciary members have equal say and power regardless of age or experience.
3. Those hearing the case and receiving summary memos must maintain the confidentiality of all proceedings and
outcomes. There will be no discussion of the decision-making process in front of the accused. Only the accused has
the right to discuss the Judiciary’s decision; it is that person’s decision alone to discuss their case.
4. If a Judiciary member is responsible for issuing a record, that member will not vote on that case or be present for its
deliberation.
5. If a Judiciary member receives a Record, that member may not be present during the deliberation of the case.
6. Personal bias of any kind against anyone may not affect the vote or discussion of a case. If a panel member feels
unable to ignore a bias, they should recuse themselves from the case.
7. If the accused is found guilty of breaking a rule, even if members of the Judiciary disagree with the rule, the Judiciary
must punish it accordingly.
8. The Judiciary is responsible for punishing any rule infractions that are uncovered during a hearing.
9. The Judiciary must meet at least once per term for a self-evaluation and discussion of any necessary changes to these
rules and the procedures herein.
10. The Judiciary may not assign cruel or unusual punishments.
11. Judiciary members are expected to attend every meeting. A member is allowed one unexcused absence before
being removed from the panel. A member is allowed four excused absences. At the fourth absence, if the absences
are deemed disruptive to the panel’s functioning, the Head of Judiciary will conduct a vote regarding the removal of
the member. In the case of any vacancy, a special election must be held as outlined in Article VII.
12. All Judiciary members must abide by these rules and procedures or be removed from the Judiciary.
Article VI – Measures Governing Behavior
The price of freedom is responsibility embodied by self-restraint and obligation. Regulations are put forth by the
Administration, the Faculty, and the Students to maintain the community’s values and the balance of freedom and
responsibility. The specific regulations can be found in the Reed-N-Heed.
I. Administrative Policies
Administrative policies are limited to issues deemed particularly significant by the Director. They are related to the
advancement of the school’s mission and the protection of the school’s good name. The development of these policies is
the responsibility of the Director alone.
II. Faculty Policies
Faculty policies are the rules and policies deemed to be significant by the Faculty. In general, they are concerned with
the school’s operation and the safety and well being of the student body. While the Faculty has the final say in the
development of Faculty Policy, students have the right to propose any revisions they see fit. Any Faculty member may
propose an amendment to the Faculty Policy. The proposed alteration is taken to the Faculty to be voted on. The
Administration may veto a proposed policy.
Note to Sections I and II:
The Administration and Faculty pledge to hear student opinion relating to the formulation of policies
that concern students, but they reserve the right to make decisions independent of the majority
opinion of students. While the Administration and Faculty are obligated to explain to the students the
reasoning behind actions taken, students’ opinions do not affect a policy’s introduction into the
Read-N-Heed.
III. Student Standards
In keeping with a commitment to the widest possible student participation in government, the Faculty shall designate
realms of the school-community in which students shall be free to govern as described in the Read-N-Heed. Such areas are
intended to develop in students a sense of duty in the exercise of freedom. The designation of Student Standards assumes
close cooperation between Faculty and Students. Students should only petition the Faculty for such designation after sufficient
prior cooperative thinking and planning by representatives of the Faculty and Council. Both Faculty and Students are
responsible for creating a favorable and supportive atmosphere when Students petition to claim a standard. The Faculty shall
refrain from transferring a Faculty Policy to Students unless there is evidence of widespread desire on the part of Students to
undertake responsible management of that area. There should be ongoing discussion between Faculty and Students regarding
the management of an assumed Standard. Faculty may not mandate changes in Standards or in Student enforcement
procedures of the Standards. It is the Faculty’s duty to re-assume control of a Student Standard if students fail to show
responsibility in their governance of that area. In withdrawing a designation of a Student Standard, the Faculty will give its
reasons first to the Council, and then to the Town Meeting, but there is no implication of a right to veto by either group.
The preferred means of enforcement of all Student Standards is persuasion, which if ineffective, may be followed by
a Record as outlined in Article V.
Student Standards are formulated by the following procedure:
Students should initiate an inquiry into the possibility of assuming responsibility for an area, or Faculty may encourage
students to assume responsibility for an area. Any student, in consultation with any member of the school-community they
choose, writes a proposal for standards or revisions to be implemented in the area in question. Faculty may also propose
changes to existing standards. There will be small group discussions of the proposed standards and means of enforcement.
The final proposal is then submitted to and reviewed by the Council. The Council will then hold a vote. If the proposed
revision passes the Council, the revisions will then be voted on in a Faculty meeting. Representatives from the Council should
attend the Faculty meeting in order to maintain thorough communication. If it passes the Faculty, the proposed Standards
must be presented in a Town Meeting and voted on for final approval. For the amendment to pass the Council, Faculty, and
Town Meeting, the revisions must have a two-thirds majority support of each. If the consultation procedure does not produce
widespread commitment to the proposal on the part of students, the Mayor will remand the matter to the originating group for
further consideration.
At the beginning of the school year, the Council should review existing standards and present them to the Town
Meeting (or to small groups) for consideration and possible revision. Standards of the preceding year are in effect until this
is done.
Article VII – Elections
In order for a democracy to survive, it must be self-perpetuating through the orderly and fair transition of power by
means of open elections.
1. Elections for the Council and the Judiciary will be held biannually near the end of each semester.
2. Only students are allowed to vote in elections. Every student, regardless of circumstance, is allowed and encouraged
to vote.
3. The Faculty has no input in who is allowed to run. Any student may run for a position regardless of circumstance.
4. In order to run for a public office, students must petition. The Council will specify and publicize the nature of the
petition for each office. Petitions for Mayor and Commissions must include platforms and signatures as defined
in Article IV and the Council is responsible for making all platforms public.
5. While students may run for only one office in the Council, they are permitted to run for the Judiciary in addition to an
office in the Council.
6. Each candidate is entrusted with using their best judgment in carrying out a campaign, should they choose to have
one. All campaign material must be appropriate and aimed at positively portraying a candidate rather than negatively
portraying a competitor. The Council may vote to disqualify a candidate who has deviated from these requirements.
7. A special Town Meeting will be held prior to each election day in which candidates may make speeches presenting their
platforms. The Council will administer this Town Meeting and make public the agenda thereof before the meeting.
8. Voting will be by secret ballot after the special Town Meeting. The Council must determine the optimal method to
conduct a fair and impartial voting process, which should be made public before voting commences. The Council
may appoint other students and Faculty members to assist them.
9. The Council will tally the votes and may appoint other students and Faculty members to assist them. The numerical
statistics are to be kept completely confidential, with only the results of the election posted and not the number of
votes each candidate received.
10. Election is by an Alternative Vote. Voters will be given the option to rank the candidates in order of First Choice,
Second Choice, etc. If the candidate with the highest number of First Choice votes obtains a majority, they win the
election. If said candidate does not receive a majority of all votes cast, the candidate with the lowest number of
First Option votes will drop out and their votes will transfer to each respective voter’s Second Choice. This process
will repeat automatically until there is a clear majority winner.
11. If less than three-quarters of the student body participates in the election, there will be a re-election. Elections for
the Commission of Boarding will require three-quarters participation from the boarding student community.
12. No candidate for an election may assist in the election process. Therefore, Council members who plan to run in the
election may neither participate in decisions that the Council makes concerning the election nor assist in
administering the voting or counting.
13. The Council must choose the members who are primarily responsible for conducting the election process. Usually,
this duty is allotted to either the Commission of Citizenship or the Commission of Protection. However, if students
holding both Commissions plan to run for office, the Council must elect two impartial council members to run the
election.
14. In the case of a vacancy in the offices of the Mayor or the Commissions, the Town Meeting must decide by a two
thirds majority vote whether or not the vacancy should be filled. In the case of a vacancy in the offices of the
Class Representatives, the relevant Class Meeting will decide by a two-thirds majority vote whether or not the
vacancy should be filled. If it is decided that a vacancy should be filled, the normal election procedure will take
place. If a vacancy should arise in the Judiciary, the vacancy must be filled by a special election.
Article VIII – Impeachment of Elected Officials
Any member of the Indian Springs school-community can suggest the impeachment of an elected student official.
There are separate processes for the impeachment and removal of students from various offices.
I. Students holding the offices of the Council may be accused and impeached by the following process:
1. The accuser must present the proposal of impeachment to the Judiciary, either in person or in writing, giving specific
reasons for impeachment. The accuser has the option to remain anonymous.
2. The Judiciary will install the Student Recorder as the Impeachment Recorder to record the arguments and proceedings
of the impeachment trial. If the Student Recorder is unable to be impartial, another member of the Judiciary may be
elected by majority vote to be the Impeachment Recorder.
3. The Judiciary can decide on the manner in which to conduct the trial but must hear both the accuser’s and the
accused’s arguments. Based on the trial, the Judiciary will decide by majority vote whether or not the
proposed impeachment should continue to the Town Meeting or the Class Meeting.
4. If the Judiciary decides to advance the impeachment case of a Class Representative, then the case will go to the
respective Class Meeting. Cases for all other Council offices will advance to the Town Meeting. The proceedings in
the preliminary stages (outlined in a, b, and c) are to remain completely confidential even after the Town Meeting
or the Class Meeting, if one is held. Only the information and arguments that the Judiciary deems important
enough for the Impeachment Recorder to present in public meetings may be disclosed, in the case of a Town
Meeting or Class Meeting. Only the Impeachment Recorder may present such information.
5. The Impeachment Recorder must make a presentation to the Town Meeting if the accused is a Mayor or
Commissioner, or to the Class Meeting if the accused is a Class Representative. This presentation should include the
accusations against the official and the accused official’s defense in an equal and unbiased manner. Students in the
Town Meeting or Class Meeting will then vote by secret ballot on whether or not to remove the impeached official
from office. If the impeachment passes the Town Meeting or Class Meeting by a two-thirds majority, the official will
be removed from office immediately.
6. The vacancy procedure outlined in Article VII will determine whether or not a special election will be held.
II. Students holding chairs on the Judiciary may be accused and impeached by the following process:
1. The accuser must present the proposal of impeachment to the Council, either in person or in writing, giving specific
reasons for impeachment. The accuser has the option to remain anonymous.
2. The Council must elect by majority vote an impartial member of the Council to be the Impeachment Recorder to record
the arguments and proceedings of the impeachment trial.
3. The Council can decide on the manner in which to conduct the trial but must hear both the accuser’s and the accused’s
arguments. Based on the trial, the Council will decide by a two-thirds majority vote whether or not the proposed
impeachment should continue to the Town Meeting.
4. The proceedings in the preliminary stages (outlined in a, b, and c) are to remain completely confidential even after the
Town Meeting, if one is held. Only the information and arguments that the Council deems important enough for the
Impeachment Recorder to present in a public meeting may be disclosed, in the case of a Town Meeting. Only the
Impeachment Recorder may present such information.
5. The Impeachment Recorder must present the accusations against the official and the defenses of the accused to the
Town Meeting in an equal and unbiased manner. Students will then vote by secret ballot on whether or not to
remove the impeached official from office. If the impeachment passes the Town Meeting by a two-thirds majority,
the official will be removed from office immediately.
6. In the case that a Judiciary member is impeached, there must be a special election to fill the vacancy.
Article IX – Amendments
Provided that every member of the school-community has the power and obligation to improve it through constructive
change, any person may submit a proposal to amend the Constitution at any time during the academic year. The proposed
amendment must first be submitted to and reviewed by the Council. The Council will hold a vote. If the proposed
amendment passes the Council, the revisions will then go to a Faculty meeting to be voted on. Representatives from the
Council should attend the Faculty meeting in order to maintain thorough communication. If it passes the Faculty, the
revisions must be presented in a Town Meeting and voted on for final approval. For the amendment to pass the Council,
Faculty, and Town
Meeting, the revisions must have two-thirds majority support of each. If at any point significant revisions are made to
an amendment, the process will begin again with the Council’s review.
The Indian Springs School Constitution
Preamble
Under the freedom granted the faculty and students of Indian Springs School by the Board of Governors of the
Alabama Educational Foundation, the governing body of Indian Springs School, there is herewith created the official Indian
Springs School Constitution.
The purpose of the Indian Springs School Constitution and Government is to promote living and learning in accordance
with humane and democratic values and principles, thereby contributing to the intellectual, physical, emotional, spiritual, and
ethical development of all members of the Indian Springs school-community.
In establishing this Constitution, the members of the Indian Springs school-community affirm that students and teachers
do not have to accept themselves or their surroundings as they are but that it is within their power to improve both through
participation in constructive change. Such participation enhances the worth and dignity of humankind, develops responsibility,
and leads persons to the realization of latent powers.
Article I – School-Community Life
The school-community exists for the purpose of providing an environment in which each individual can develop to his
or her full stature.
I. Rights
Each individual has certain rights that are equal for each person. Individuals are guaranteed maximum freedom so long
as they do not infringe upon the rights of others or threaten the general welfare of the school-community.
This Constitution guarantees:
1. The right to freedom of religion, speech, inquiry, and criticism.
2. The right of students to select representatives in the government.
3. The right of students to run for public office.
4. The right to petition the Council or Faculty.
5. The right to assemble peacefully.
6. The right to be considered innocent until proven guilty.
II. Values and Ideals
Certain values and ideals are prized because they contribute to making the school-community a better place in which to
live and learn. Each individual is responsible for working toward the realization of these values and ideals.
In our school-community, we aspire to:
1. Show respect towards the opinions and beliefs of others.
2. Develop genuine friendships.
3. Respect the worth and dignity of the individual.
4. Widen the area of common agreement by which decisions are made and actions taken.
5. Develop personal integrity and moral courage.
6. Help individuals to develop their talents and skills.
7. Stimulate individuals to give direct, unselfish service to the school-community.
8. Reflect disapproval of behavior wherein one individual does or says things harmful to another or to the good name of
the school.
9. Prohibit any organized group that divides or tends to divide the school-community.
We encourage individuals to:
1. Accept their political responsibilities.
2. Keep informed about school-community jobs because the general welfare requires it.
3. Voice opinions and demands directly to the proper officials.
4. Use democratic methods to achieve group agreement.
5. Consider the common good before group or personal liberties.
6. Live in accordance with agreed-upon standards.
7. Evaluate the school-community continuously in an effort to improve it.
Article II – Structure of the Government
The divisions of government are:
1. The Director of Indian Springs School, who is appointed by the Board of Governors.
2. The Administration.
3. The Faculty.
4. The Student Government:
a. Town Meeting: a legislative body comprised of all students that, second to the Administration and Faculty, is the
authority of government at Indian Springs.
b. Council: an executive body comprised of the Mayor, the Commissions, and the Class Representatives. c.
Judiciary: a judicial body comprised of students who hear and rule on infractions of policies, rules, and standards.
Article III – Town Meeting
The heart of the Government at Indian Springs School is the Town Meeting. Town Meeting is open to all citizens and
has three main functions:
1. The Town Meeting serves as the legislative branch of Government and is the final authority on all issues in which the
Faculty is neutral. While the Town Meeting is open to all citizens, only students are allowed to vote. Three-quarters
of the student body constitutes a quorum. Decisions will be made by at least a two-thirds majority vote. The
presiding officer will determine whether the voting will be secret or public.
2. The Town Meeting serves as an open forum in which students can freely voice their concerns and opinions about
pressing issues in an effort to improve the overall quality of life in the school-community.
3. The Town Meeting is a means of communication among all citizens of the school-community. Because a democracy
cannot survive unless its citizens remain consistently informed, weekly meetings are encouraged; however, the
frequency of meetings is determined by need.
Town Meetings are called either by the Mayor with the consent of the Faculty or by the Faculty. Students have the right to
request to have a Town Meeting either through the Council, Faculty, or Director. The Mayor has the right to call a
students-only Town Meeting.
The presiding officer of the Town Meeting is the Mayor. In the absence of the Mayor, the Council will designate a presiding
officer. However, if the Town Meeting is called by the Faculty, the Director or someone designated by the Faculty may take
charge of the meeting.
Article IV – The Council
The Council is a body of students elected entirely by the students for the purpose of providing leadership in the
community. The most important responsibility of the Council is to assess the quality of school-community life and improve it
on as many levels as possible.
I. The offices of the Council are:
1. The Mayor, whose duty is to provide leadership for the Council and the community as a whole in building a greater
understanding of the aims and purposes of the community and to bring about the realization of these aims and
purposes through the various Council offices. The Mayor is responsible for seeing that each Council office fulfills
its respective duties and platforms and for coordinating the work of the Council.
2. Commission of Citizenship, whose duties are concerned with the continuing evaluation of the quality of citizenship as
exhibited on a day-to-day basis, in and out of the classroom, and in the larger community beyond the boundaries
of Indian Springs School. Specific examples can include, but are not limited to, organizing Development Day,
promoting service opportunities, and overseeing student clubs.
3. Commission of Education, whose duties are concerned with the continuing evaluation and improvement of teaching
and learning and of the conditions that influence the academic experience. Specific examples can include, but are
not limited to, managing the Writing Center, creating a student tutor system, and participating in Academics
Committee meetings.
4. Commission of Protection, whose duties are concerned with the enforcement of the standards of the school-community
and the promotion of environmental protection. Specific examples can include, but are not limited to, reporting
attendance at mandatory meetings and issuing Records for unexcused absences at such meetings, organizing and
carrying out campus recycling, and discouraging littering, and managing matters surrounding the American flag(s)
flown on campus. Members of the commission are, in a special sense, guardians of the rights, values, principles, and
ideals set out in this Constitution. The preferred method of enforcement of such standards is persuasion. However,
where persuasion does not prove successful, the commission may take more stringent measures.
5. Commission of Recreation, whose duties are concerned with the continuing evaluation and improvement of wholesome
recreational activities in the school-community. Specific examples can include, but are not limited to, organizing
school dances, planning Winter Formal, and leading activities that promote school spirit.
6. Commission of Services, whose duties are concerned with the continuing evaluation and improvement of the range of
needed services in the school-community. The most evident example of this duty is the operation of the student
store.
7. Commission of Boarding, whose duties are concerned with the continuing evaluation and improvement of dormitory
life, which involves the facilitation and execution of dormitory administration such as maintenance and rule
enforcement. The Commission is to be elected from and by the boarding student community as outlined in Article VII.
8. Deputies, who are students installed by a specific Commission to aid in the execution of its duties and to expand
community participation in Government. Each Commission may have up to three Deputies, with the exception of
Commissioners of Boarding, who may have up to two deputies in each dormitory. No one in any of the Council
offices may become a Deputy, and Deputies may serve only one Commission. Deputies are nominated by the
Commission and must be approved individually by the Council. The Commission or the Council may remove a Deputy
at any time; when a Commission leaves office, the Deputies of that Commission also leave their posts. Deputies do
not have a vote in the Council but are strongly encouraged to attend Council meetings.
9. Class Representatives, whose duties are concerned with the continuing evaluation of opinions and desires of their
respective classes. Class Representatives are responsible for organizing and voicing class concerns to the Council
and for taking attendance for their respective grades at mandatory meetings. Each class will elect one or two
representatives from its own class and for its own class.
10. The Council Secretary, whose duties are concerned with the documentation and communication of recent plans,
updates, and discussions mentioned during Student Government and Town Meetings and contributing to task
management within the Council. Specific examples can include, but are not limited to, taking notes during Council
meetings, taking notes during Town Meetings, and assisting the Mayor in certain projects. These notes must be
reviewed and approved by the Council before their release. The Council Secretary does not have a vote in the
Council. The Council Secretary is nominated by the Mayor and must be approved individually by the Council through a
⅔majority vote.
II. Additional responsibilities of the Council:
1. Each office of the Council must prepare a written platform, a program of action to be implemented during the specified
term of office. This platform should present the goals and methodology for the office.
2. The Council should hold regular meetings to discuss and evaluate ongoing programs. The meetings are compulsory for
all members unless a viable excuse is given. Embracing the principles of democracy, all members of the school
community are encouraged to attend Council meetings.
3. The Council must, at times, make decisions on items such as those called for in this Constitution. In order to make
these decisions, the Council must vote. Three-quarters of the Council constitutes a quorum, and decisions will be
made by a two-thirds majority vote.
4. The Council must administer elections at the end of each semester, as outlined in Article VII.
5. The Mayor has final responsibility for the effectiveness of the Council, and the Director of Indian Springs School has
final responsibility for the effectiveness of the Faculty Liaisons, which are mentor Faculty members assigned to
each Commission and Class. It is the duty of the Mayor and Director to see that the Commissions and Liaisons
develop a unified program in order to improve specific aspects of the school-community from the vantage point of
a comprehensive view of school-community problems.
Article V – The Judiciary
The Indian Springs School Judiciary is a panel elected entirely by the students for the purpose of hearing and ruling on
infractions of policies, rules, and standards within the school-community. The Judiciary is composed of eleven students and
one Faculty Liaison. The eleven-member panel must be composed of one 8th (for the second semester only), one 9th, one
10th, one 11th, and one 12th grader as well as two boarding students, elected by popular vote by the entire student body.
Once these stipulations have been met, the remaining spots will be filled by those receiving the highest number of votes. Any
student who wishes to run for the Judiciary is both welcome and encouraged to do so. The Faculty has no input regarding
who is allowed to run.
I. Offices of Judiciary
There are two offices of Judiciary: the Head of Judiciary and the Student Recorder. Both positions are elected at the first
Judiciary meeting following general elections by a combined panel of incoming and outgoing members of the Judiciary. Voting
is anonymous, and offices are decided by majority vote.
1. The Head of Judiciary is the leader of the panel and serves as a guide and moderator during discussions rather than a
member advocating their own opinions. The Head of Judiciary has no vote during regular meetings except in the case of a tie,
where they serve as a tiebreaker. In order to run for Head of Judiciary, a student must have previously served at least one
term on the panel, if there is such a person. The Head of Judiciary is responsible for organizing meeting times, bringing a
copy of the Read ‘n’ Heed, Records, and precedents to every meeting, taking attendance at meetings, and notifying the
accused of the accused offense as well as the date, time, and location of the hearing. After each hearing, it is the Head’s
responsibility to provide the Dean of Student Life with a report of all cases, rulings, and work hours or other punishments
given.
2. The Student Recorder keeps an accurate record of the decisions made by the Judiciary and serves as the
Impeachment Recorder during the impeachment of a Council member as outlined in Article VIII. In the event of the Head of
Judiciary receiving a Record, the Student Recorder assumes the role of Head of Judiciary for that case.
II. The Faculty Liaison
The Faculty Liaison to the Judiciary is the Faculty’s representation on the panel. They serve only as a guide; students
maintain the primary responsibility and control of the Judiciary. The Faculty Liaison may voice an opinion, act as a clarifier
and interpreter of the rules, and assist in interrogating the accused. They may not vote during regular meetings or during
the election of offices. The Faculty Liaison is responsible for creating a written memo of all proceedings of the Judiciary to
distribute to the Director, the Dean of Academics, the Dean of Student Life, and the Dean of Residential Life. The Faculty
Liaison is expected to abide by all policies, rules, and procedures of the Judiciary.
III. The Dean of Student Life
The Dean of Student Life is not a member of the Judiciary and is not present during meetings; they serve as an outside
assistant in executing the administrative duties of the Judiciary. After each meeting, an outline of all decisions, including a
breakdown of the work hours and/or other punishments and their corresponding offenses, is given to the Dean of Student
Life by the Head of Judiciary. The Dean of Student Life is responsible for notifying each student and their Faculty Advisor of
the work hour assignment and/or other punishment given by the Judiciary. It is the Dean of Student Life’s responsibility to
keep track of work hours performed and time frames for other punishments for each student. When a Faculty member
submits a record, they are to be informed of the case’s outcome by the Dean of Student Life.
IV. Judiciary Procedure
Persuasion is the primary means of enforcement of the rules in the school-community. However, acknowledging that a
warning may not alter behavior in all situations, a Record may be issued after persuasion has been attempted. Any member of
the community may write a Record to report a rule infraction. Records are submitted to the Head of Judiciary through email.
In the Record, the accuser should provide a detailed written explanation of the situation along with any other relevant
information. If there is not enough information from the accuser to prove guilt, the accused should be deemed innocent. Prior
to the
hearing, the Head of Judiciary may ask the accuser if there is more information associated with the record. The responsibility
for providing details falls on the accuser in order for the Judiciary to remain the jury rather than the prosecutor. The accuser
may choose to remain anonymous during the proceedings of the hearing. The accuser should provide all relevant information
in the original record, but may request to attend the hearing if he or she would like to provide additional information. When a
Record is submitted, the Head will alert the Judiciary, the accused, and the accuser (when necessary) of the date, time, and
location of the hearing. Meetings should be called as regularly as possible. Six members of the Judiciary other than the Head
must be present to constitute a quorum.
The accused must appear before the Judiciary on the specified day. If the accused does not do so and does not provide a
viable excuse, they will automatically be given a set punishment. On the day of the hearing, the Head will read the Record
aloud and explain the case to the Judiciary. The Judiciary will then summon and question the accused concerning all aspects
of the case and any connected incidents. Upon completion, the accused will leave the room. Only the eleven members of the
Judiciary and the Faculty Liaison are allowed to be present during deliberation. The panel must first determine if the accused is
innocent or guilty. The accused is considered innocent until proven guilty. If the accused is deemed guilty, the precedent
system—a written record of past rule infractions and their correlating punishments—will be used as a guide during the
deliberation of punishment. However, due to the uniqueness of each case, the precedent system should not necessarily be
followed. Finally, the Judiciary will set a punishment by majority vote. If at any point during the process the Judiciary
determines it has inadequate information, the panel reserves the right to postpone a case until more information has been
gathered from relevant parties. The accused may also be summoned for additional questioning for clarification.
On the following school day, the accused must report to the Dean of Student Life to receive their punishment. If work
hours were assigned, the accused must then contact the appropriate adult to establish a schedule for the completion of the
work hours. If the work hours are not completed within the set time period, the accused will be charged with “work hour
delinquency,” and the uncompleted number of hours shall be doubled automatically. If the accused vehemently maintains their
innocence yet is given work hours, they have the right to formally submit an appeal by email to the Judiciary. After the Dean
of Student Life and the Director are notified of the petition, the Judiciary will hold another hearing to reexamine evidence and
question relevant parties.
Strict confidentiality must be maintained throughout the entire Judiciary process.
V. Judiciary Rules
1. All Judiciary members and the Faculty Liaison must act with seriousness of purpose, maintain respectful conduct, and
lead by example. This is of the utmost importance to the effectiveness of the Judiciary, which must maintain the
respect of the community to function properly.
2. All Judiciary members have equal say and power regardless of age or experience.
3. Those hearing the case and receiving summary memos must maintain the confidentiality of all proceedings and
outcomes. There will be no discussion of the decision-making process in front of the accused. Only the accused has
the right to discuss the Judiciary’s decision; it is that person’s decision alone to discuss their case.
4. If a Judiciary member is responsible for issuing a record, that member will not vote on that case or be present for its
deliberation.
5. If a Judiciary member receives a Record, that member may not be present during the deliberation of the case.
6. Personal bias of any kind against anyone may not affect the vote or discussion of a case. If a panel member feels
unable to ignore a bias, they should recuse themselves from the case.
7. If the accused is found guilty of breaking a rule, even if members of the Judiciary disagree with the rule, the Judiciary
must punish it accordingly.
8. The Judiciary is responsible for punishing any rule infractions that are uncovered during a hearing.
9. The Judiciary must meet at least once per term for a self-evaluation and discussion of any necessary changes to these
rules and the procedures herein.
10. The Judiciary may not assign cruel or unusual punishments.
11. Judiciary members are expected to attend every meeting. A member is allowed one unexcused absence before
being removed from the panel. A member is allowed four excused absences. At the fourth absence, if the absences
are deemed disruptive to the panel’s functioning, the Head of Judiciary will conduct a vote regarding the removal of
the member. In the case of any vacancy, a special election must be held as outlined in Article VII.
12. All Judiciary members must abide by these rules and procedures or be removed from the Judiciary.
Article VI – Measures Governing Behavior
The price of freedom is responsibility embodied by self-restraint and obligation. Regulations are put forth by the
Administration, the Faculty, and the Students to maintain the community’s values and the balance of freedom and
responsibility. The specific regulations can be found in the Reed-N-Heed.
I. Administrative Policies
Administrative policies are limited to issues deemed particularly significant by the Director. They are related to the
advancement of the school’s mission and the protection of the school’s good name. The development of these policies is
the responsibility of the Director alone.
II. Faculty Policies
Faculty policies are the rules and policies deemed to be significant by the Faculty. In general, they are concerned with
the school’s operation and the safety and well being of the student body. While the Faculty has the final say in the
development of Faculty Policy, students have the right to propose any revisions they see fit. Any Faculty member may
propose an amendment to the Faculty Policy. The proposed alteration is taken to the Faculty to be voted on. The
Administration may veto a proposed policy.
Note to Sections I and II:
The Administration and Faculty pledge to hear student opinion relating to the formulation of policies
that concern students, but they reserve the right to make decisions independent of the majority
opinion of students. While the Administration and Faculty are obligated to explain to the students the
reasoning behind actions taken, students’ opinions do not affect a policy’s introduction into the
Read-N-Heed.
III. Student Standards
In keeping with a commitment to the widest possible student participation in government, the Faculty shall designate
realms of the school-community in which students shall be free to govern as described in the Read-N-Heed. Such areas are
intended to develop in students a sense of duty in the exercise of freedom. The designation of Student Standards assumes
close cooperation between Faculty and Students. Students should only petition the Faculty for such designation after sufficient
prior cooperative thinking and planning by representatives of the Faculty and Council. Both Faculty and Students are
responsible for creating a favorable and supportive atmosphere when Students petition to claim a standard. The Faculty shall
refrain from transferring a Faculty Policy to Students unless there is evidence of widespread desire on the part of Students to
undertake responsible management of that area. There should be ongoing discussion between Faculty and Students regarding
the management of an assumed Standard. Faculty may not mandate changes in Standards or in Student enforcement
procedures of the Standards. It is the Faculty’s duty to re-assume control of a Student Standard if students fail to show
responsibility in their governance of that area. In withdrawing a designation of a Student Standard, the Faculty will give its
reasons first to the Council, and then to the Town Meeting, but there is no implication of a right to veto by either group.
The preferred means of enforcement of all Student Standards is persuasion, which if ineffective, may be followed by
a Record as outlined in Article V.
Student Standards are formulated by the following procedure:
Students should initiate an inquiry into the possibility of assuming responsibility for an area, or Faculty may encourage
students to assume responsibility for an area. Any student, in consultation with any member of the school-community they
choose, writes a proposal for standards or revisions to be implemented in the area in question. Faculty may also propose
changes to existing standards. There will be small group discussions of the proposed standards and means of enforcement.
The final proposal is then submitted to and reviewed by the Council. The Council will then hold a vote. If the proposed
revision passes the Council, the revisions will then be voted on in a Faculty meeting. Representatives from the Council should
attend the Faculty meeting in order to maintain thorough communication. If it passes the Faculty, the proposed Standards
must be presented in a Town Meeting and voted on for final approval. For the amendment to pass the Council, Faculty, and
Town Meeting, the revisions must have a two-thirds majority support of each. If the consultation procedure does not produce
widespread commitment to the proposal on the part of students, the Mayor will remand the matter to the originating group for
further consideration.
At the beginning of the school year, the Council should review existing standards and present them to the Town
Meeting (or to small groups) for consideration and possible revision. Standards of the preceding year are in effect until this
is done.
Article VII – Elections
In order for a democracy to survive, it must be self-perpetuating through the orderly and fair transition of power by
means of open elections.
1. Elections for the Council and the Judiciary will be held biannually near the end of each semester.
2. Only students are allowed to vote in elections. Every student, regardless of circumstance, is allowed and encouraged
to vote.
3. The Faculty has no input in who is allowed to run. Any student may run for a position regardless of circumstance.
4. In order to run for a public office, students must petition. The Council will specify and publicize the nature of the
petition for each office. Petitions for Mayor and Commissions must include platforms and signatures as defined
in Article IV and the Council is responsible for making all platforms public.
5. While students may run for only one office in the Council, they are permitted to run for the Judiciary in addition to an
office in the Council.
6. Each candidate is entrusted with using their best judgment in carrying out a campaign, should they choose to have
one. All campaign material must be appropriate and aimed at positively portraying a candidate rather than negatively
portraying a competitor. The Council may vote to disqualify a candidate who has deviated from these requirements.
7. A special Town Meeting will be held prior to each election day in which candidates may make speeches presenting their
platforms. The Council will administer this Town Meeting and make public the agenda thereof before the meeting.
8. Voting will be by secret ballot after the special Town Meeting. The Council must determine the optimal method to
conduct a fair and impartial voting process, which should be made public before voting commences. The Council
may appoint other students and Faculty members to assist them.
9. The Council will tally the votes and may appoint other students and Faculty members to assist them. The numerical
statistics are to be kept completely confidential, with only the results of the election posted and not the number of
votes each candidate received.
10. Election is by an Alternative Vote. Voters will be given the option to rank the candidates in order of First Choice,
Second Choice, etc. If the candidate with the highest number of First Choice votes obtains a majority, they win the
election. If said candidate does not receive a majority of all votes cast, the candidate with the lowest number of
First Option votes will drop out and their votes will transfer to each respective voter’s Second Choice. This process
will repeat automatically until there is a clear majority winner.
11. If less than three-quarters of the student body participates in the election, there will be a re-election. Elections for
the Commission of Boarding will require three-quarters participation from the boarding student community.
12. No candidate for an election may assist in the election process. Therefore, Council members who plan to run in the
election may neither participate in decisions that the Council makes concerning the election nor assist in
administering the voting or counting.
13. The Council must choose the members who are primarily responsible for conducting the election process. Usually,
this duty is allotted to either the Commission of Citizenship or the Commission of Protection. However, if students
holding both Commissions plan to run for office, the Council must elect two impartial council members to run the
election.
14. In the case of a vacancy in the offices of the Mayor or the Commissions, the Town Meeting must decide by a two
thirds majority vote whether or not the vacancy should be filled. In the case of a vacancy in the offices of the
Class Representatives, the relevant Class Meeting will decide by a two-thirds majority vote whether or not the
vacancy should be filled. If it is decided that a vacancy should be filled, the normal election procedure will take
place. If a vacancy should arise in the Judiciary, the vacancy must be filled by a special election.
Article VIII – Impeachment of Elected Officials
Any member of the Indian Springs school-community can suggest the impeachment of an elected student official.
There are separate processes for the impeachment and removal of students from various offices.
I. Students holding the offices of the Council may be accused and impeached by the following process:
1. The accuser must present the proposal of impeachment to the Judiciary, either in person or in writing, giving specific
reasons for impeachment. The accuser has the option to remain anonymous.
2. The Judiciary will install the Student Recorder as the Impeachment Recorder to record the arguments and proceedings
of the impeachment trial. If the Student Recorder is unable to be impartial, another member of the Judiciary may be
elected by majority vote to be the Impeachment Recorder.
3. The Judiciary can decide on the manner in which to conduct the trial but must hear both the accuser’s and the
accused’s arguments. Based on the trial, the Judiciary will decide by majority vote whether or not the
proposed impeachment should continue to the Town Meeting or the Class Meeting.
4. If the Judiciary decides to advance the impeachment case of a Class Representative, then the case will go to the
respective Class Meeting. Cases for all other Council offices will advance to the Town Meeting. The proceedings in
the preliminary stages (outlined in a, b, and c) are to remain completely confidential even after the Town Meeting
or the Class Meeting, if one is held. Only the information and arguments that the Judiciary deems important
enough for the Impeachment Recorder to present in public meetings may be disclosed, in the case of a Town
Meeting or Class Meeting. Only the Impeachment Recorder may present such information.
5. The Impeachment Recorder must make a presentation to the Town Meeting if the accused is a Mayor or
Commissioner, or to the Class Meeting if the accused is a Class Representative. This presentation should include the
accusations against the official and the accused official’s defense in an equal and unbiased manner. Students in the
Town Meeting or Class Meeting will then vote by secret ballot on whether or not to remove the impeached official
from office. If the impeachment passes the Town Meeting or Class Meeting by a two-thirds majority, the official will
be removed from office immediately.
6. The vacancy procedure outlined in Article VII will determine whether or not a special election will be held.
II. Students holding chairs on the Judiciary may be accused and impeached by the following process:
1. The accuser must present the proposal of impeachment to the Council, either in person or in writing, giving specific
reasons for impeachment. The accuser has the option to remain anonymous.
2. The Council must elect by majority vote an impartial member of the Council to be the Impeachment Recorder to record
the arguments and proceedings of the impeachment trial.
3. The Council can decide on the manner in which to conduct the trial but must hear both the accuser’s and the accused’s
arguments. Based on the trial, the Council will decide by a two-thirds majority vote whether or not the proposed
impeachment should continue to the Town Meeting.
4. The proceedings in the preliminary stages (outlined in a, b, and c) are to remain completely confidential even after the
Town Meeting, if one is held. Only the information and arguments that the Council deems important enough for the
Impeachment Recorder to present in a public meeting may be disclosed, in the case of a Town Meeting. Only the
Impeachment Recorder may present such information.
5. The Impeachment Recorder must present the accusations against the official and the defenses of the accused to the
Town Meeting in an equal and unbiased manner. Students will then vote by secret ballot on whether or not to
remove the impeached official from office. If the impeachment passes the Town Meeting by a two-thirds majority,
the official will be removed from office immediately.
6. In the case that a Judiciary member is impeached, there must be a special election to fill the vacancy.
Article IX – Amendments
Provided that every member of the school-community has the power and obligation to improve it through constructive
change, any person may submit a proposal to amend the Constitution at any time during the academic year. The proposed
amendment must first be submitted to and reviewed by the Council. The Council will hold a vote. If the proposed
amendment passes the Council, the revisions will then go to a Faculty meeting to be voted on. Representatives from the
Council should attend the Faculty meeting in order to maintain thorough communication. If it passes the Faculty, the
revisions must be presented in a Town Meeting and voted on for final approval. For the amendment to pass the Council,
Faculty, and Town
Meeting, the revisions must have two-thirds majority support of each. If at any point significant revisions are made to
an amendment, the process will begin again with the Council’s review.

INDIAN SPRINGS SCHOOL MISSION:
Guided by our motto, Learning through Living, Indian Springs School fosters a love of learning
and creativity, a sense of integrity and moral courage, and an ethic of participatory citizenship
with respect for individuality and independent thought.
OUR GUIDING PRINCIPLE
Indian Springs School believes that the students it accepts are reasonably intelligent people who
know the difference between right and wrong, between acceptable and unacceptable behavior. It
further believes that most of its students are capable of acting responsibly if given a chance to be
responsible, and that it should not exercise rigid control over their lives. The school does have
rules and expects them to be observed, but it does not conduct 24-hour surveillance of the
students. This does not mean, however, that freedom is license at Indian Springs or that the
school is following a head-in-the-sand, “hear no evil, see no evil” policy. To do so would be
foolish because there are always students in any school who may, at times, behave irresponsibly
and abuse their freedom in a manner that is harmful to their well-being, to that of other students,
or the good name of the school. When the school becomes aware of such behavior, it will not
hesitate to take whatever action it believes necessary to protect the welfare of the school
community.
A final point: since the varieties of human behavior appear to be endless, it is impossible to give
a precise definition of the term “unacceptable behavior” agreeable to everyone. That
determination must be made by the school administration, and this is as it should be. If the
school trusts that most students will act responsibly in using their freedom, then those students
must trust that the school will also act responsibly in determining when the abuse of that freedom
has resulted in “unacceptable behavior” and in deciding what action should be taken.

ABOUT THIS HANDBOOK
The Parent and Student Handbook (the “Handbook”) is intended as a general guide for families
to the policies, procedures, and personnel at Indian Springs School. Please take the time to
carefully review the Handbook, including reviewing it with your children. It is important that
families understand the School’s expectations and policies, and that families know to whom they
can direct their questions or concerns.
Please understand that the Handbook is intended only to highlight current policies, practices, and
procedures. The policies and procedures set forth herein are intended as general
guidelines—specific situations may call for handling a matter in a manner different from that
described herein, depending upon the particular facts and nature of the situation. However, it
would be nearly impossible to review every element of every policy or every possible scenario
and outcome. Rather, the Handbook serves as a series of policy summaries to keep your family
better informed.
Modifications
From time to time, circumstances will require that the policies, practices, and procedures
described in the Handbook change. Indian Springs reserves the right to modify or change any or
all such policies, practices, and procedures in whole or in part, at any time, with or without
notice. The School will attempt to provide timely notice of any substantive policy changes, but it
cannot guarantee that such notice will be provided.
Should events which are beyond the School's reasonable control and which occur without its
fault or negligence necessitate a closure, delay, or modification of its educational programs and
activities, the family's obligations as outlined in the Handbook, as set forth in the Enrollment
Agreement, and/or as otherwise established by the School shall continue. The School shall not
be liable for any failure, delay, or modification of its programs or activities. The School reserves
the right to make modifications to the school year as necessary to account for any time lost due to
any closure or delay, including without limitation the following: extending the school year for a
period of time equal to the time lost due to any delay; conducting classes via distance-learning;
and/or scheduling weekend classes. Possible events that could necessitate closure, delay, or
modification as described above include, but are not limited to, acts of nature, fire, pandemic,
U.S. Government restrictions, wars, and insurrections.

INTRODUCTION
The rules and standards that form the guidelines for individual behavior at Indian Springs School
have evolved from a broadly-based system of governance set forth in the School Constitution.
Faculty and students have discussed the principles and goals of the School and have arrived at
policies and standards which are designed to promote a unique environment for living and
learning.
As instructed in Article VI of the Indian Springs School Constitution, the Read ‘n’ Heed contains
three sets of regulations put forth to maintain the community’s values and the balance of freedom
and responsibility—Administrative Policies, Faculty Policies, and Student Standards. The
Administrative Policy supports Faculty Policy and Student Standards and promotes the process
by which these guidelines are determined.
ADMINISTRATIVE POLICY
The purpose of Indian Springs School’s Administrative Policies is to advance the mission and
core values of the School. The school values true scholarship, embraces diversity in its many
forms, and promotes an environment that rewards and fosters good character. In addition to
overseeing the important work with young people in their development of intellect and character,
the administration is charged with the professional and ethical responsibility of maintaining the
reputation and good name of the School.
Community Expectations and Policies
Discrimination
Educational excellence begins with a culture of respect. At Indian Springs, members of our
community come from many different backgrounds and cultures, including different races,
religions, sexual orientations, and ethnic ancestries. The School encourages its community to
appreciate the richness that such diversity provides a learning environment; understanding
differences among people is an important dimension of education.
Indian Springs is dedicated to creating an educational environment that promotes respect and
dignity for all members of the community and is free from all forms of harassment and unlawful
discrimination. These behaviors are demeaning to all persons involved and are unacceptable
Return to Table of Contents
5
conduct. Harassment of any member of the community by any other member of the community,
vendors, visitors, or third parties will not be tolerated.
Non-Discrimination
The School admits qualified students of any race, color, national or ethnic origin, ancestry, sex,
religion, disability, or sexual orientation to all the rights, privileges, programs, and activities
generally accorded or made available to students at the School. The School does not
discriminate on the basis of race, color, national or ethnic origin, ancestry, sex, religion,
disability, or sexual orientation, or any other status protected by applicable law in the
administration of its educational, admissions, financial aid, athletic and other policies and
programs.
Inclusivity and Gender Identity
The School strives to provide a safe and supportive environment that will help students succeed
academically and socially. To that end, the School promotes respect for all people, and will not
tolerate harassment or bullying based on gender identity or expression that impacts a student's
experience at the School (whether the bullying or harassment takes place on or off campus),
including cyber-bullying through the use of electronic technology. Particularly with respect to
transgender and gender non-conforming students, the School will work closely with students and
their families to strive to honor students’ wishes with respect to use of school facilities, the
accuracy of student records, use of preferred name and pronouns, and privacy, in accordance
with applicable law, and to the extent that the School’s campus facilities reasonably permit.
Harassment
Harassment based on the target’s protected characteristic refers to unwelcome conduct or
behavior that is personally offensive or threatening and has the effect of (i) creating an
intimidating, hostile or offensive environment, (ii) interfering unreasonably with an individual’s
ability to participate in or benefit from the School’s program, or (iii) creating a situation where
academic decisions affecting a student depend on the student’s submitting to and/or not objecting
to the behavior. Such behavior can occur between two people who are equals, such as
student-student or between people with different levels of institutional power, such as teacher
and student.
Sexual Misconduct
Indian Springs is dedicated to providing a safe, supportive, and healthy environment that
cultivates a love of learning, personal growth, and a sense of integrity and moral courage. All
forms of sexual misconduct interfere with this mission and will not be tolerated.
Return to Table of Contents
6
Faculty, administrators, and staff members must maintain healthy, respectful boundaries and
relationships with students at all times. All romantic or sexual advances (overt or otherwise) or
activity between adults and students of any age (including students over the age of 18) are
prohibited, on or off the grounds, even if a student encourages or appears to encourage such
advances or activity.
See Appendix A for important definitions, examples, and related information.
Bullying and Hazing
Indian Springs prohibits conduct that is disrespectful of, and physically and/or emotionally
hurtful to others, including but not limited to bullying (including cyber-bullying) and hazing.
The School is also committed to promptly addressing any behavior that is impeding the learning
of any student or interfering with the experience of any other member of the school community.
Indian Springs expects that all members of the school community will conduct themselves with
respect for the personal dignity of fellow community members.
See Appendix A for important definitions, examples, and related information.
Retaliation
Retaliation is any form of intimidation, reprisal, or harassment directed against a student who
reports misconduct or provides information during an investigation of such behavior. Retaliation
against any individual for reporting possible violations of the policy is also in violation of school
policy. A student may violate this anti-retaliation provision regardless of whether the original
complaint turns out to be true or the retaliation was not intended to be harmful (“it was just a
joke”). Retaliation may include behaviors such as ostracization of the reporter or having rumors
or misinformation spread about the reporter. Each retaliatory offense will be investigated and
sanctioned separately.
Reporting Complaints
Students who have experienced sexual misconduct, harassment, discrimination, hazing, bullying,
or retaliation by another student or an adult, or who have witnessed or otherwise have
information about such an incident, are encouraged to seek help immediately from the school
counselor, the school nurse, an administrator or advisor, or a trusted adult. The person who
receives the report will make sure it reaches the proper channels for investigation. In all cases,
every effort will be made to maintain privacy. No confidential personnel, student, or
investigation information may be released other than as necessary to conduct the investigation or
school business in compliance with the School’s policy.
Return to Table of Contents
7
Sanctuary
To encourage reports to the School regarding sexual misconduct, the School will not discipline
student victims of sexual misconduct, or bystanders who provide information in order to help
student victims, for violations of school rules that may have taken place immediately prior to or
at the time of the sexual misconduct they are reporting.
Major School Rules
The following behaviors are classified as major school rule violations and are prohibited at any
time or place, for so long as a student is enrolled at the School:
●
Physical, oral, written, or electronic harassment, including violence or threatened violence
toward another person, bullying, hazing, or unwanted advances of a sexual nature.
●
Serious breaches of personal or academic integrity, including dishonesty in interactions with
Faculty or Staff.
●
The use, possession, distribution, transport to campus, or sale of alcohol, drugs (including
controlled substances, but excluding medications prescribed to the relevant student), tobacco,
vaping and / or drug paraphernalia, or other substances used to alter the student’s normal
mental or emotional state.
●
The misuse, distribution, or sale of prescription or over-the-counter medications or chemical
substances, whether one’s prescription or others’.
●
Theft, destruction, or vandalism of property, whether physical, electronic, digital, or
otherwise, including disruption of the school program and unauthorized possession of
campus keys or digital access codes.
●
Sexual misconduct or other sexual activity that the School deems inappropriate.
●
Possession or use of weapons or dangerous substances, other than in a school- or
parentally-approved activity. Weapons and dangerous substances include fireworks,
firearms, firearm or para-military paraphernalia, knives, any other weapons (or associated
paraphernalia), or any item or substance that causes intimidation, threatens the safety of any
student or the school community, or disrupts the educational environment.
Return to Table of Contents
8
●
Conduct that interferes with the School program, operations, or educational environment or
that jeopardizes the well-being of any student or students, the welfare of the community, or
the School’s reputation, whether on campus, on the internet, or off-campus, including a
conviction for a felony.
Disciplinary Process
Indian Springs School operates on a two-tier disciplinary system.
The Judiciary: The Judiciary is a panel of eleven students, elected entirely by the students, and
at least one faculty liaison, that hears minor disciplinary cases involving rules and standards
other than Major School Rules. Any member of the community may write a “Record” to report a
rule infraction. The Record is emailed to the head of Judiciary, and parties are notified of the
date of the hearing. If the Judiciary decides a student is guilty of the infraction described in the
Record, discipline will include a determination of “work-hours” to be assigned to that student.
Decisions by the Judiciary may be appealed by submitting an email to the Judiciary. Once the
Dean of Students and Head of School have been notified of the petition for appeal, the Judiciary
will hold another hearing. All other relevant rules and procedures pertaining to the Judiciary are
listed in Article V of the Constitution.
The Discipline Committee: The School strives to ensure consistency and fairness in disciplinary
matters. The Discipline Committee is a panel of faculty members appointed by the Head of
School that makes recommendations to the Head of School in cases involving Major School Rule
violations. Decisions in such cases are the Head of School’s on behalf of the School. Appeals
must be in writing and made directly to the Head of School. Procedures for the Discipline
Committee are set forth below.
Procedures and Consequences for Violations of Major School Rules
After a violation of a Major School Rule has been alleged and brought to the attention of the
School, an impartial, fact-finding investigation is conducted by the Head of School or designee.
In most cases, the Dean of Students investigates Major School Rule violations. This
investigation may include (but is not necessarily limited to) interviews with the students
involved in or implicated by the incident, witnesses to the incident, and any other parties who
may have information relevant to the alleged incident. The investigator(s) may consult with
teachers, staff, the parents/guardians of the students who were involved, or any other person
whom the investigator(s) deem(s) to have knowledge about the incident. The School may also
Return to Table of Contents
9
deem it appropriate to use external investigators to review an incident or complaint. In certain
circumstances, the School may be obligated to report misconduct to external authorities, such as
to law enforcement or the county Department of Human Resources.
Students are expected to cooperate in investigations. Failure to cooperate with an investigation
may be cause for disciplinary action. If a student refuses to participate or cooperate at any stage
of an investigation for whatever reason, including, but not limited to, pending criminal charges,
the School reserves the right to take action, including proceeding without a statement from the
student.
The School may contact parents to address both minor and more serious instances of misconduct,
at any stage of the discipline process. Students and parents understand and accept that, in the
case of a serious infraction, a student may be required to go on leave, such as during an
investigation. This would be considered a non-disciplinary leave and should not be considered a
conclusion by the School of any wrongdoing. During such a leave, the School will not count
those absences towards the student’s absence tally, and will work with the student to continue
their educational experience to the extent possible, such as through tutoring, online learning, and
other methods.
After any investigation, the Dean of Students convenes a private meeting of the Discipline
Committee, notifying the relevant students and parents of the time and nature of the meeting.
The Discipline Committee is charged with confirming what has occurred and recommending
consequences to the Head of School. The student’s faculty advisor (or another faculty member
at the student’s request) attends the committee meeting as an advocate and liaison. Parents do
not attend meetings of the Discipline Committee. The Head of School or other representative of
the School typically contacts parents within 24 hours with the School’s decision.
Violations of major school rules may result in a student’s probation, suspension, or dismissal
from the School. In some cases, parents may elect to withdraw their child from the School.
In cases leading to disciplinary probation, the student is expected to maintain a record of good
conduct during the probationary period. Depending on the violation, the Discipline Committee
may recommend further consequences, including, but not limited to, work hours, written
apologies, and financial restitution.
In cases leading to suspension, the student is placed on disciplinary probation and is asked to
leave school for 1-3 days. All of the terms relating to disciplinary probation above apply to the
probationary period during the suspension. In addition, absences during a suspension count
Return to Table of Contents
10
toward the student’s total absences, and teachers are not required to reteach material missed.
Students suspended for drug and alcohol use are expected to avoid the use of such illegal
substances during the course of their disciplinary probation and may be required to submit to
periodic, unannounced drug and alcohol screening.
In cases leading to dismissal or withdrawal, the student and parent may petition for readmission
to Indian Springs School after a period away from the School of one semester has elapsed. The
School is under no obligation to grant readmission.
The Head of School’s or Dean of Student’s letter to the student’s parents sets out in detail the
School’s disciplinary decision.
While it is necessary and prudent for the School to take a firm stand on student discipline, it also
recognizes that the education process must allow room for mistakes and the normal growth
experiences of adolescents. Most first Major School Rule violations result in suspension and
probation. The exceptions are offenses that involve serious matters of student safety and health
or otherwise compromise the campus life and the integrity of the institution.
During the college application process, colleges and universities often ask for students’
disciplinary history during their high school career. Students must answer the question honestly
in a written statement to the admission office. If a disciplinary infraction occurs after a college
application has been submitted, the School will report such infraction to the students’ colleges if
required. It is the School's policy to support students in reporting serious disciplinary
consequences to colleges. The student should work closely with the Director of College
Advising to ensure that both are responding in a consistent and thoughtful manner.
In the event the Discipline Committee cannot be convened in a timely manner and/or the nature
of the infraction requires immediate action by the School, the student may not be required to
appear before the Discipline Committee; rather, the case will be reviewed by the Dean of
Students and/or the Head of School in consultation with such other administrators as the Dean or
Head of School deems appropriate. On these occasions, these administrators will review the
facts of the case, as known, and any interviews with the appropriate students and faculty
involved in the situation and conduct such other inquiry and review as may be deemed necessary
by them before making a decision about appropriate responsive or disciplinary action.
Academic Dishonesty Procedure
Return to Table of Contents
11
Plagiarism, cheating, or otherwise presenting for academic credit work that is not one’s own is a
Major School Rule violation. In addition to consequences from the Discipline Committee, up to
probation, suspension, or dismissal, cheating on an academic assignment may result in academic
penalties. Students should always check directly with the teacher whenever there is any question
about the degree of collaboration or the kinds of sources allowed on a given assignment.
Questions should always be resolved before work is turned in for credit. A student who feels
strongly that another student is cheating is directed to speak with that student or a faculty
member.
As soon as a teacher believes that a student has committed an act of academic dishonesty, the
teacher will go to the department head with the evidence. Teachers who are themselves
department heads will seek the opinion of a fellow department head. If both concur that enough
evidence exists to indicate that cheating has taken place, both the Dean of Academics and the
Dean of Students will be notified of the facts of the case, the teacher will meet with the student,
and faculty advisors will be informed of the matter.
If evidence still points to academic dishonesty having taken place, the Deans will meet with the
student in a timely fashion and decide either:
a) to issue a strong warning and advise the parents by phone and in a letter that will be
placed in the student’s file, or
b) to recommend that the student appears before the Discipline Committee.
Any academic penalty is at the discretion of the teacher.
Acceptable Technology Use
Indian Springs provides its students access to a variety of technological resources (“IT
Resources”) that assist in furthering the School’s mission of preparing students for a life of
critical, ethical, and global thinking. It is the responsibility of students to exercise appropriate
personal responsibility in their use of these resources. This technology use policy provides
guidelines that govern the efficient, ethical, and legal use of these resources.
These policies apply at all times while a student is enrolled at Indian Springs, regardless of
whether a student is physically on-campus or off-campus, whether during the school day or at
night, whether connected to the School’s network or using another network. Overall, students
Return to Table of Contents
12
should understand that the guidelines and expectations for in-person interactions and behavior
are equally applicable to interactions and behavior while using IT Resources.
Acceptable Use Policy
The acceptable use policy applies to all students who are using Indian Springs’ IT Resources,
including, but not limited to, the network, telephones, computers, mobile devices, printers, and
software.
IT Resources must be used respectfully and as authorized and designed. While using
school-owned IT Resources or a student’s device on the school’s network, no student is
authorized to engage in any activity that violates school policy or any illegal activity under
applicable law. Students may be held personally and financially responsible for malicious or
intentional damage done to any of the IT Resources at Indian Springs. The use of IT Resources
are revocable privileges for all users. Violating any portion of this policy may result in
disciplinary action, including a temporary or permanent ban on computer or Internet use,
suspension, or dismissal from school and/or legal action.
Digital Citizenship
Indian Springs expects students to use IT Resources in safe, legal and responsible ways. A
responsible digital citizen is one who:
Respects Oneself. Students will select online names that are appropriate and will consider the
information and images that are posted online and the long-lasting implications of making
information public on the Internet. Students will protect their personal safety online and keep
personal information of both themselves and others private.
Respects Others. Students will refrain from using technologies to bully, tease, or harass other
people, both on and off campus. Students are required to obtain permission from the School
before making online posts about faculty, staff, administrators, or the School itself. Being a good
citizen online is no different from being a good citizen face-to-face.
Protects Oneself and Others. Students will protect themselves and others by reporting abuse and
not forwarding inappropriate materials or communications.
Respects Intellectual Property. Students will suitably cite any and all use of websites, books,
media, etc.
Return to Table of Contents
13
Protects Intellectual Property. Students will request to use the software and media made by
others.
Proper Network Use
Students may not engage in any activity that interrupts personal productivity or the service of
any IT Resources. Students further may not intentionally disrupt, damage, or alter data, software
or other IT Resources belonging to the School or to any other individual or entity. This includes
spreading viruses, sending spam messages, performing denial of service attacks, compromising
another person’s ability to use IT resources, performing system/network scans, and intercepting
another person’s network traffic.
Students may not tamper with, disable or circumvent any security mechanism, including
software applications, login account controls, network security rules, hardware devices, etc.
Students may not introduce any prohibited technology resources that could disrupt operations or
compromise the security of the school’s IT resources.
Students may not use peer-to-peer file-sharing programs to download or share copyrighted
movies, music, or games.
Inappropriate Content and Language
Indian Springs has the right to place reasonable restrictions on the material accessed or posted
through the network using school-provided devices or personal devices. Students may not seek
to bypass network restrictions by using a proxy site or other technology, such as USB flash
drives, virtual private networks, or file-sharing sites.
In addition, students may not use the school’s network to access, transmit, download, post or
communicate the following: material that is obscene or includes vulgar or inappropriate
language; pornography; material that depicts, or describes in an offensive way, violence, nudity,
sex, death or bodily functions; material that promotes or advocates illegal activities; material that
promotes the use of alcohol or tobacco, school cheating or weapons; material that is false or
defamatory; or material that advocates participation in hate groups or other potentially dangerous
groups.
Students must promptly disclose to the Head of School or any other employee with whom the
student feels comfortable any message received that is in violation of the restrictions on
inappropriate language and unauthorized activities.
Return to Table of Contents
14
If students mistakenly access inappropriate information, they should immediately report this
access to the Head of School or any other employee with whom the student feels comfortable.
This will protect them against a claim that they have intentionally violated this policy. If they
feel that the filtering software is blocking their access to an appropriate site, they should report
this to the Head of School or any other employee with whom the student feels comfortable.
Email Usage
All use of email must be consistent with Indian Springs’ policies and procedures of ethical and
legal conduct.
Students should refrain from using their Indian Springs account for non-school related
communications. All email accounts are owned by the School, and access can be revoked at any
time. Students should have no expectation of privacy when using their Indian Springs’ email
account or any IT Resources.
Students are responsible for securing access to their email accounts.
Protecting School and Personal Information
It is important for all users of technology to be aware of the many ways in which data can be
compromised. Social engineering and phishing are attacks that rely heavily on users providing
information about themselves or your organization to the attacker. The attacker tricks users into
giving out information that bypasses standard security practices. For example, students may
receive an email that appears to be from Google, PayPal, or any other company they’ve done
business with, that contains a link for them to click. The link often leads to a login screen where
they are then supposed to enter their username and password. Students should never trust emails
like these that ask for personal and identifiable information. They are often meant to trick users
into sharing login information for malicious purposes. Clicking these links and/or entering the
information can lead to the theft of account information and possibly allow an attacker to gain
access to other accounts.
These attacks may also happen over the phone. The attacker may ask individuals to confirm
information about themselves or the School, or they may ask the student to visit a website that
will allow them to gain remote access to an individual’s device. Individuals are advised to hang
up when they receive these calls.

Students must remain vigilant against these attacks. It is a good practice to change passwords
often and never use the same password for different accounts. Students are encouraged to invest
in a good password keeper to securely store passwords.
Personal Device Rules
Students may bring their own devices — for example, cell phones, laptops, and tablets — to
school and connect them to the Indian Springs network. The same rules in this policy apply to
these devices as well. While your personal device is at school, you should use it the same way
you would use a school device, and the rules and guidelines in this policy still apply.
Student Data and Privacy
Since more and more of our students’ schoolwork is saved on the Internet, making sure that their
data and educational records are secure and protected is a task we take very seriously. It is
important to note that any information shared on the Internet is at some risk of compromise, but
we will do our best to protect privacy, while also teaching our students best practices in creating
usernames/passwords and deciding what to share online and whom to share it with. We will
work with families to make sure they are aware of the services our students are using, and the
ways in which their data is being used. We will obtain parental permission before signing our
students up for sites or services that require more than a name and email address, and we will
make sure we do not engage with companies that sell our students’ data to third parties or use it
for marketing purposes. By working to model positive attitudes about data and privacy for our
students, we can teach them to be engaged, informed digital citizens.
Campus Hours
Boarding Student Hours
Rules regarding boarding student hours and access to campus can be found in the Residential
Life Handbook.
Day Student Hours
The campus is open to day students only during the school day and official School events on
weekends or after hours. Day students should leave campus immediately following their last
obligation at the school for the day. Should there be a circumstance in which a student must stay

General Respect for Campus Use
Please note that misuse of or misbehavior in any campus space, including dorms, may result in
any student’s privilege of use being revoked or their visiting hours being shortened. All dorm
rules must be followed by all guests per the Residential Life Handbook. Students should make a
note of the following number in case they need help or assistance after 4:00 PM on weekdays or
on a weekend/non-academic day: Dorm Cell: 205.337.7168
FACULTY POLICY
Faculty Policies are the rules and policies deemed to be significant by the Faculty. In general,
they are concerned with the School’s operation and the safety and well-being of the student body.
For each of the following areas of school life, there is a statement of general policy, followed by
specific procedures. It is important to understand and to act in accordance with the spirit of the
policy, as well as to adhere to the specific guidelines that are listed.
General Decorum
Respect for the worth, dignity, and needs of the individual is more than a policy at Indian
Springs School; it lies at the heart of the School’s philosophy that education should be social and
spiritual, as well as academic.
Acceptance of others and understanding their rights is fundamental to our culture and part of our
core value of Infinite Respect.
1. Hazing and harassment in any form, whether physical or psychological, are unacceptable
in our community. Persistent or serious harassment is a Major School Rule violation.
2. Students are expected to dress appropriately for school situations, including using good
judgement, avoiding dirty clothes, overly revealing garments, etc. Attire or grooming
depicting or advocating violence, criminal activity, use of alcohol or drugs, pornography,
or hate speech is prohibited.
3. Quiet should be maintained where appropriate. For example, music played in the
dormitory area during the school day must not be heard in the classroom area, and noisy
games and other distracting behavior must not be engaged in near classrooms.
4. Students are expected to use cell phones and other technology appropriately for school
situations. They should not be used during class, Town Meetings, Community Dining,
performances, and lectures unless otherwise told by a faculty member.
Return to Table of Contents
17
The Library
The Library should be a place conducive to quiet study and research.
1. The main reading room is reserved for quiet individual study. Books, magazines, and
materials used in the library should be returned to the proper places. Furniture is not to
be moved or rearranged without permission. Study carrels are for small group study.
Groups larger than 4 will need to use another space on campus.
2. All circulating items, including books, materials ,and equipment, must be checked out by
using the computer at the front desk. Judiciary records will be given for books
improperly removed from the library. Students will be responsible for late fees on
checked out materials and assessed for lost or damaged materials.
3. No food or drink is allowed in the reading room with the exception of water in a closed
container.
Lake and Creek Use
Any lake activity presents the possibility of a serious accident. Safety procedures must be
observed. Please note that lifeguards are not on duty, and the School does not guarantee adult
supervision of students when swimming in and boating on the lake. If parents believe that their
child is not a capable swimmer, parents must inform the student that they are not permitted to
use the lake.
1. Swim only in the designated area near The Hut.
2. Never swim alone.
3. No diving.
4. No pushing, shoving, or running along the concrete walls and spillway.
5. No throwing stones.
6. No swimming during thunder and lightning storms.
7. Water sports must not threaten the safety or interfere with the fun of others.
8. No swimming after dark.
9. Never go out in a boat alone; always have life jackets, one for each person in the boat.
10. Equipment must always be returned to the proper location.
11. The use of the lake is restricted to Indian Springs students and staff.
12. Throwing others into the lake is unacceptable.
13. Students are not permitted to cross or be in the creek without a faculty member.

18
Fund Drives
While the School encourages service projects, it does not generally support the simple collecting
of money for a cause.
1. Any project that will involve the collecting of money from students or their families must
be approved by the Student Government Council, the Dean of Students' Office, and the
Development Office.
2. Accurate records of funds raised must be maintained, and the funds turned in to the
Business Office for safekeeping.
3. Reimbursements will be made following any fund drive after receipts are turned in to the
Business Office.
Attendance
Indian Springs School is a community committed to learning and dedicated to participation and
enthusiastic involvement of all its members, both faculty and students. One part of this
dedication is a focus on the time that we spend together. To optimize this time together we are
committed to all students and faculty attending class daily and consistently arriving on time.
However, as sickness, family emergency, religious observation, or other events may preclude
attendance, and that adolescents may fail at times to meet all obligations, it is unreasonable to
assume that no classes will be missed by those in the community. It is expected, however, that
such instances will be held to a minimum and communicated in advance to the Front Desk
(205.988.3350) whenever possible.
What’s potentially at stake if you miss class?
At Indian Springs, we believe that active participation in the educational process is integral to the
overall experience of our students. We believe in Learning Through Living and therefore believe
that class attendance contributes to that experience. Attending class is one of the many ways that
we build relationships within our community, increase resiliency in our students, and prepare
them academically for the future. Regularly missing classes goes against that belief and can also
affect the following:
❖Mental/Physical Exhaustion - The increased workload from making up
assignments/assessments can leave students feeling overwhelmed, which can also
increase anxiety;
❖Student Academic Performance - Attendance is directly proportional to academic
performance. That is, as attendance increases, academic performance tends to increase;
Return to Table of Contents
19
❖Standardized Test Scores - Frequent absences result in a lack of exposure to material that
may appear on standardized tests and could result in poor performances on the
standardized tests;
❖Student-Teacher Relationships - Given that teachers are in daily contact with their
students, many relationships are formed and thrive at Indian Springs, so students can miss
out on wonderful relationships by not attending classes.
❖Future School Choice - Overall, missing class has an adverse effect on many aspects of
the educational experience which can ultimately affect your choices after Indian Springs.
Given this view of attendance, the following is the attendance policy for Indian Springs School.
School Attendance Policy
If a student is absent for more than 10 meetings (20 meetings) of a one-semester (two-semester,
resp.) class, then that student will move from 0-100 grading to Cr/NCr grading for transcript
reporting purposes. Numerical grading will continue to be reflected on student report cards. The
threshold for Cr will be the deficiency level of 73% and the Cr/NCr will only be reflected on the
student’s transcript. If a student earns a Cr/NCr grade, said course will not be used in GPA
calculations but will earn credit toward graduation if a “Cr” is assigned. An assignment of
“NCr” will not earn credit toward graduation.
If a student misses 20 or more minutes of a single class session, for whatever reason, it will be
considered an absence. Only those activities designated as part of the school programming or
that are religious observances will not contribute to the absence tally. Examples include
school-sponsored sports, choir, competitions, and on-campus college visits. Once a student
reaches 8 absences (18 absences, resp.) in a class, a notification will be sent to the student and
their family so they may plan accordingly.
Policy on Lateness
Day students must sign in in the front office if they arrive on campus after their first class has
begun.
Each faculty member may deal with tardiness according to their individual policies. As
participation is an expected component of student performance, even where it is not specifically
graded by the faculty member, the student’s final grade may be adjusted for lateness.
Return to Table of Contents
20
Additional Attendance Requirements
As attendance at Town Meetings and Advisory is compulsory, an unexcused absence subjects the
offender to a record.
Indian Springs School understands that unforeseen events can occur, which may cause a student
to be absent for an extended period. If such an event is the primary cause of the 10/20 absences,
an appeal to the Assistant Head of School for Academic Affairs, Dean of Students, and Head of
School for an exception to the policy can be made.
Permission to Leave Campus
No student may leave the school grounds at any time without obtaining appropriate permission.
The School requires that every student have a current Student Permission Form on file, signed by
a parent regarding transportation, signing out, etc. These permission forms are renewed
annually. A student who does not have the form on file may not exercise the privileges of
signing out, riding in school transportation, etc. For example, when a student leaves campus in a
car driven by anyone other than their parent or guardian, the student must have explicit
permission to ride with that person, and the person with whom the student is riding must have
written parental permission to transport that student.
Day students must sign in at the Front Office if they arrive on campus after 8am and sign out if
they leave before 3:20pm. Students must also have permission from parents to sign out before
3:20pm. This can be granted by a parent emailing Annie.Galey@indiansprings.org and
Jourdan.Cunningham@indiansprings.org or calling the Front Desk, or the student calling a
parent when they are at the Front Desk to sign out.
Boarding students should sign in and out with the ResLife Staff member on duty at all times
according to ResLife Handbook policy.
Students are not required to sign out when they leave campus in an Indian Springs group under
Faculty or Staff supervision (with an athletic team or choir, for example). Faculty or Staff in
charge of students will leave a list in the front office of all students leaving the campus.
Personal and School Property

Office for the creation of any merchandise that makes use of the School's name or logo. The
approved logo may be obtained from the Communications Office. Students are not permitted to
use the School logo on social media, even for school-related accounts.
Off-Campus Visitors
The School does not operate an open campus. Students may not receive visiting students from
other schools during the school day. All other visitors (including parents and guardians) should
register at the front office.
Please see the Residential Life handbook for policies applicable to visitation in the dorms.
Student Vehicles
Driving on campus is a privilege. The use of motor vehicles requires good sense and the highest
regard for safety. Violation of the following rules, which are understood to include any form of
careless driving, may lead to immediate suspension of car privileges.
Students may bring motor vehicles to the campus and use them only for specific reasons and
under agreed-upon conditions. Any student who is planning to drive a car to school at any time

School-Sanctioned Clubs
The objective of the following policies and procedures is to encourage more students to become
actively involved in the School and the community at large through school clubs and activities.
In particular, these policies and procedures strive to develop in students the perspective of being
more productive citizens and to give them the means by which to do so.
1. Faculty Sponsorship: Whenever possible, each club will have at least two faculty
sponsors who are enthusiastic about the purpose of the club and committed to helping
ensure the club’s success. With the understanding that students should take leadership
roles, the sponsors monitor the overall productivity and efficiency of the club’s
management, giving guidance to keep the club on task.
2. Mission Statement: At the beginning of each school year, the sponsor and members of
the club should engage in discussion and draft a three-tiered mission statement. This
mission statement should address how the club plans to (1) benefit the community at
large, (2) benefit Indian Springs School, and (3) promote the development of citizenship
of the individual members of the club. The statement should include detailed plans for
carrying out these three objectives for the current year.
3. School Support: (1) The School will ensure there is a time and place for club meetings, as
having a predictable time and place has proven significant to the success of a club. (2)
The School will provide financial assistance where possible. A standard plan needs to be
devised, in conjunction with the Dean of Students' Office, to facilitate the authorization of
this assistance and provide budget management. (3) The School may help sponsor these
events, such as Heritage Panel programs or the Intercultural Dinner. These events should
promote the club’s purpose and should benefit all.
4. Club Coalitions: At least one representative from each school-sanctioned club is required
to participate in coalition meetings.
A comprehensive packet of club guidelines and checklists has been developed by the Dean of
Students' Office to support clubs and activities at Indian Springs School.

APPENDIX A
Legal Definitions and School Policies
In accordance with the Indian Springs’ mission, values, and standards of conduct, the School has
supplemented certain legal definitions and concepts in order to articulate Indian Springs’
philosophy toward addressing disrespectful and harmful misconduct. In essence, the School’s
standards may be stricter than the law, and the School may impose discipline accordingly. For
example, although the law defines bullying as “a continuous pattern” of certain expressions, acts,
and/or gestures, Indian Springs reserves the right to apply disciplinary measures and other
corrective action in a case of a single expression, act, or gesture, if the School determines that it
is of sufficient severity to warrant disciplinary measures or other remedial action. Conduct need
not meet the legal definitions of harassment, discrimination, hazing, or bullying to violate the
School’s expectations for appropriate behavior. The School’s efforts to enhance its protection of
students in no way expands an individual’s rights under the law.
Sexual Misconduct - Definitions
Sexual Misconduct: Sexual misconduct is a broad term that encompasses unwelcome behavior
of a sexual nature that is committed without consent, as defined below. Sexual misconduct can
be committed by a person of any gender, and it can occur between people of the same gender or
different gender. Any sexual misconduct which endangers the health or wellbeing of another
student may result in dismissal. Examples of sexual misconduct include:
●
Sexual Assault: Non-consensual sexual intercourse or unwanted sexual contact.
●
Sexual Exploitation: Taking non-consensual sexual advantage over another, including
electronically recording, photographing, or disseminating images of intimate body parts
without consent of the person or parties, spying on the private sexual activity of another
or others, or allowing a third party to observe sexual activity without the consent of all
the parties.
●
Relationship violence: Threatening or abusive behavior that can be physical, mental, or
sexual that is intended to control another person. Parties must be or have been in a
dating, romantic, or sexual relationship.
●
Stalking: Persistent, unwanted, and repeated attention, based on gender, gender identity,
or expression, causes the targeted person to fear for their safety or suffer substantial
emotional distress.
●
Sexual Harassment: Unwelcome conduct or behavior that is personally offensive or
threatening, which has the effect of impairing morale, interfering with a student (or
employee’s) work or school performance, or creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive
school environment. Examples include offensive sexual language or jokes or gestures of
Return to Table of Contents
28
a sexual nature. For more details, please see the School’s Sexual Harassment policy
below.
●
Sexting: The use of technology devices to send any written message or image that
contains explicit representations or references to sexual conduct, sexual excitement, or
nudity. The law prohibits anyone (regardless of age) from disseminating obscene or
pornographic images of minors, and the School is required under Alabama law to contact
law enforcement should any student violate this policy.
Consent: Each person engaged in sexual activity must verbally communicate consent clearly and
voluntarily at every stage of a sexual encounter. They must understand and abide by the rules of
consent which include:
●
Consent cannot be inferred by silence or the absence of “no.” Clear consent, given
through affirmative words, is necessary.
●
Consent to some sexual acts does not imply consent to others, nor does past consent to a
given act imply present or future consent. Consent must be ongoing and can be revoked
at any time.
●
Consent obtained by threat, coercion, or force does not constitute consent.
●
Consent cannot be obtained from someone asleep or otherwise mentally or physically
incapacitated, whether due to alcohol, drugs, or some other condition.
It is important to note that, in Alabama, students under the age of 16 cannot legally consent to
sexual activity. Consequently, such activity may violate state laws, and school personnel may be
required to report such instances to state or local authorities.1
Sexual Harassment
Our policy seeks to educate members of the community about the nature of sexual harassment,
do whatever we can to prevent it from occurring, and appropriately respond when it is found to
have occurred.
Sexual Harassment is defined as sexual advances (either verbal or physical), requests for sexual
favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature which affects a person’s
emotional well-being or interferes with a student’s academic performance or participation in
1 Alabama statutory rape law is violated when an individual over age 18 (or 16 or older if the
victim is at least 2 years younger than the offender) engages in sexual intercourse with a person
under age 16.

co-curricular or extracurricular activities, or which has the purpose or effect of creating an
intimidating, hostile, or offensive learning or social environment.
The School is unequivocally committed to promoting the safety and integrity of student growth.
We endeavor to provide instruction to all members of the school community about the proper
roles and relationships that comprise community life. We focus on the importance of
maintaining appropriate boundaries. We expect that the life experience of adults at the School
will enrich the student’s learning experience. We place the student’s best interests above all
other considerations.
Identifying Sexual Harassment:
Sexual harassment can take various forms, many of which violate state or federal laws. Not all
forms of sexual harassment may be readily apparent to every member of the community. It may
be direct and overt, or it may be subtle and ambiguous. It may be behavior that is repeated, or it
may be behavior that occurs only once. It is not social or courting behavior between equals, but
rather the assertion of power over another individual that puts that individual at a disadvantage.
Individuals might unintentionally act in a manner that others experience as sexually harassing. It
is the responsibility of all members of the community to ensure that their words, actions, and
interactions with others always reflect the intent to promote respect and trust. Attempts to justify
such behavior as a “prank” or “joke” do not change its harassing nature if the object of the joke
is not a willing participant. Whatever the basis for the harassment, it is prohibited.
When trying to identify whether a behavior is “harassing,” it is crucial to distinguish
student-to-student interactions from sexual intimacy between students and adults, which is
always prohibited. When these behaviors occur between an adult and a student, it is irrelevant
whether the behavior is welcome or unwelcome. There is no circumstance in which these
behaviors between adults and students are permissible.
The following behaviors are examples of harassing behaviors. The list is suggestive rather than
exhaustive, and members of the community should seek advice and assistance in any
circumstance in which they are made to feel uncomfortable by the behaviors of another.
Some examples of behavior that may constitute sexual harassment (whether or not the intent or
consequence of the behavior make the offended person feel uncomfortable):

Cyber-Bullying
“Cyber-bullying” is bullying through the use of technology or electronic devices, including, but
not limited to, telephones, cellular phones, computers, pagers, electronic mail, instant messaging,
text messaging, social media apps, and websites. Cyber-bullying includes:

Hazing
“Hazing” occurs when any student, alone or acting with others, subjects another student to a
physical or mental health injury, or threatens or endangers a student’s physical or mental health,
as part of an initiation, or as a prerequisite to membership, into any organized school group,
including any club, athletic team, or other similar group. Hazing may also involve coercion or
intimidation of a student to act or to participate in or submit to any act. Even if a student
consents to participate in a ritual or activity as part of an initiation or a prerequisite to
membership, it can still be considered hazing if psychological or physical harm is inflicted.
